I was getting a couple of beers in GG Bros and they bouled in, asking the owner daft questions about what he had in stock, wee guy comes right up to me and starts with the classic lines of, 'that's a nice camera', 'how much is it worth?' then starts to poke at it. He's taking the piss and I know what's coming next. As I leave, he follows me with some aggro chat, while also grabbing at his hoodie pocket like he has a knife so I turn to him and scream, \\\"GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME, NOW!\\\" I went full rozzer! He backs off but re-groups with his 4 or 5 pals. I had to get a taxi out of the area. I'd expect this kind of shit in Naples or parts of London but not Glasgow. Never thought I'd say this but the rozzers need to up their game. I've lived in Glasgow 34 years and never seen such brazen cheek!\", \"author\": \"Mr_Bear12345_6\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-08-25T01:20:53.271652\"}",
