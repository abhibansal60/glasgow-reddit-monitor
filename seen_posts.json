I know that posts about the standards of driving here are common but this week I feel the need to reiterate some points to both Glasgow born van drivers, and newer Glaswegians on our roads, speaking purely as an emergency response driver and someone who's car was written off with my child in the car on Thursday by a weegie in a van, nice enough bloke but only had his licence back a year.....\\n\\nFilter lanes: if you need to make a right turn and enter a filter lane without a light on a major road, you wait until the oncoming lane is clear before you enter it. Especially if a vehicle is directly beside you and crossing the line to make progress before you commence your turn. Get off your fucking phone/open your eyes/wait that extra second vs deciding to ram into the side of a vehicle who has right of way who thought because you'd stopped on approach that you knew how to drive.\\n\\nVehicle size: Know your driving abilities. I see some absolute shambles with people in big motors hesitating with spaces a bus can get through blocking traffic, people who canni do a 3 point turn, reverse out a parking space etc. It's like driving in fucking Nairobi doing the school run these days and gives me palpitations. The dings on the cars tell their own story. If you aren't a confident driver, learn on a wee car like we all fucking did, and usually a banger for that very reason. I shouldn't see P plates on a range rover or an x5.\\n\\nFilter lanes MK2 for our international drivers etc: if you have 3 lanes and wish to enter the right hand lane to turn right, please join the queue to do so like everyone else. Do not proceed up the middle lane to go straight ahead then decide to turn right at the junction and proceed in front of other vehicles who are driving legally and almost causing a collision. If you decide to do so, do not then take umbrage at horns making you aware of other drivers positions and decide to stop completely further up the road to become an obstruction blocking them, waving your wee hands etc to have a tantrum. You may, one day come across the wrong person (or when theor child isnt in the car) who decides to get out and educate you in an aroused manner. \\n\\nFinal point: if you do indeed do both these things, do not then decide to pull over and allow the previously aroused but now calm driver to pass you so that you can tailgate them home in an intimidating manner for 10 minutes just because you've been beeped. When they get out of their car at the lights to speak to you with a wave and a smile (was genuinely only wanting to educate you on the filter lane to avoid you getting any more grief), the least you could do is remain as you are and take the helpful advice rather than turn in a dangerous manouvre and fuck off. If you're going to tailgate someone for 10 minutes it kinda gives the impression that you have something to discuss and abandoning the conversation just creates extreme disappointment when all the foreplay leads to nothing. This isn't Kabul and you aren't in an ambush. So stop driving like you are and have some manners. \\n\\nWho the fuck is teaching these people to drive? I can ignore most poor manouvres and ill judged decisions made with good intentions when a blue light is behind you (though that is also quite a straight forward thought process tbh) but when I'm in my own car I see some absolute lizard level driving. It has definately gotten worse in the last 5 years. I enjoy driving but there are some absolute mutants on the road atm!\\n\\nRant over.

This is a complex one but I'll condense it the best I can. \\n\\nLong story short, she is ending/has ended a tenancy in sheltered housing due to a mouse problem. She left last night. She was set to move in with a friend's brother yesterday, but after realising the situation isn't safe for her (he smokes a lot of weed and apparently goes mental now and again) is now not moving in and has nowhere else to go. We are unsure if she is able to return to the sheltered housing - the tenancy may technically still be hers right now (she emailed them to let them know she was leaving with immediate effect but tenancies generally don't work like that) but she is refusing to stay there and we don't know if she has returned the keys. \\n\\nShe is unable to stay with us and she has no other family in the UK and very few friends. We have paid for a hotel room in the city centre until Tuesday and after this she is on her own.\\n\\nWe have given her the number for the council weekend homeless line and signposted her to the Simon Community incase they are able to help or give advice, however she has essentially made herself homeless and may technically still have a tenancy so are aware she would likely not qualify for any support. We have also offered to pay for a flight to her home country as she would have somewhere to stay there for a while but has flat out refused. She is stubborn to the point where we think she would genuinely rather sleep on the streets than return to her home country for a while.\\n\\nSo far she has refused to phone the council and does not want to visit the Simon Community today or possibly ever as she has a history of refusing support. She was offered to stay with a neighbour for a few days which she turned down, and had the potential to stay with the friend who's brother smokes weed but has also turned this down. \\n\\nJust reaching out to see if anyone has any other advice we can give to her before we step away from the situation - unstable housing/making bad decisions around housing/going homeless has been an ongoing cycle for her for years and we are done. She is on jobseekers and housing benefit which would make finding a flat/flatshare more difficult. \\n\\nAgain, I'm aware that because she has essentially made herself homeless she might not be eligible for any help anywhere but it never hurts to ask. I am a literal support worker so I have a semi-decent knowledge of support services to signpost to and even I'm stumped as to what to do with her. \\n\\nIf anyone has any idea as to what on earth to do here please leave a comment l, this is the last ditch at offering her advice before she truly has to do it on her own.

The follow Glasgow Times article is from 15 August explaining the changes: https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/25394636.changes-spt-cut-price-rail-travel-scheme-revealed/\\n\\nHowever, when you look at SPT\\u2019s website (which is where most people would go to check it especially if you\\u2019re not a Glasgow resident) , it hasn\\u2019t been updated and it still says that you get 50% off a standard fare: https://www.spt.co.uk/about-us/news/strathclyde-concessionary-travel-scheme-fare-changes-from-1-april-2025/\\n\\nThis is, once again, a major change that SPT haven\\u2019t bothered to communicate properly to NEC pass holders. It feels grossly unfair that we\\u2019ve not been able to fully benefit from the scrapping of peak fares.

The same account, while reposting a video which purported to show asylum seekers fighting in Spain, commented \\u201cgas them all\\u201d \\u2014 a phrase used on another, this time deleted, video.\\n\\nNow, The Bell can reveal that a north Glasgow man called Kieran Logan is behind the X account and the Tartan Team\\u2019s fundraiser. He\\u2019s also behind a Facebook profile which left the following comment on a post about the flags: \\u201cTime for a stand people if you want involved in the movement give me a message and I\\u2019ll get you flags sorted or if you need help getting your flag up.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\nThe comment finished by saying \\u201ctime to look after our own not everyone else\\u201d. Other users then made requests of Logan to fly flags in their area.\\u00a0\\n\\nWe contacted Kieran Logan via the same Facebook account. He responded saying \\u201cyou have the wrong Kieran\\u201d. However, The Bell was able to link two other X accounts that Logan tagged regularly to two profiles in his Facebook friend list. The profile images from the X accounts matched his friends\\u2019 Facebook profiles. It was this Kieran Logan who made the above comment.\\n\\nOver the week, we debated whether or not to name Kieran Logan. On Monday, we didn\\u2019t, as we were still working to fully confirm his identity. Now, given how prominent the flags are across north Glasgow, and that many interpret them as a symbol of independence, we believe our readers will want to know who\\u2019s been getting behind this emerging movement, which appears to be growing.\\n\\n# Tartan contradictions\\n\\nWhen we messaged the Tartan Team on Monday, they said that \\u201cimmigration is not a problem\\u201d for them. Instead, on their Facebook page, the Tartan Team say the flags are a \\u201cstand against politicians and councillors\\u201d who have gone \\u201cquiet\\u201d on issues the city is facing. These include NHS struggles, drug deaths, cost of living, mental health, and a housing crisis.\\u00a0\\n\\nTo them, Glasgow being one of the UK\\u2019s main dispersal cities for asylum seekers and, in their words, Westminster having \\u201cfailed to give funding to facilitate this\\u201d, is what is causing division. They also acknowledge that Scotland \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t be the country we are\\u201d without immigration.\\u00a0\\n\\nYesterday, off the back of growing support, the group announced that they plan to help the elderly, disabled people, and the homeless with essentials as the colder months approach, and that any new donations to them will go towards those causes.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\nYet that comes alongside the anti-immigration rhetoric from some of their followers whom they\\u2019ve engaged with. While there is no indication that any other member of the Tartan Team shares Logan\\u2019s views on gassing asylum seekers or spreading Nazi propaganda, it\\u2019s notable that the group\\u2019s TikTok account has liked several inflammatory comments on their videos. This includes a comment that says Milton is \\u201cfull\\u201d of immigrants and that young migrant men are \\u201cpraying \\\\[sic\\\\]\\u201d on women, and another that refers to migrants as \\u201cbeasts\\u201d.\\u00a0\\n\\n# \\u2018Masquerading as patriotism\\u2019\\n\\nMuch of the discussion locally about the flags going up is about what the saltire represents and who gets to decide what it means. On Monday, we heard from Maryhill resident Laurie Goldie, who set up an online petition to \\u201cchange the narrative\\u201d of the flags and oppose \\u201cracism, xenophobia, and hate in all forms\\u201d.\\n\\nIn a\\u00a0[widely-shared video](https://fb.watch/C44078w_Bq/?ref=glasgowbell.co.uk), Father Jim Lawlor of the Immaculate Conception Catholic church in Maryhill, said that the flags are \\u201cmasquerading as patriotism and nationalism, but it\\u2019s on the back of something far more sinister\\u201d.\", \"author\": \"Buachaille\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-13T09:38:24.776850\"}",

    "1njjqjo": "{\"text\": \"Driving in Glasgow - some observations. Feel free to comment as some of these may be controversial, but I don\\u2019t think they are. Some are generic to driving.\\n\\n*Glasgow has many bus lanes/gates. However, a good amount of these are only operational during peak times and the operational times are quite clearly displayed. Outwith the specified times, the \\u201cbus lane\\u201d becomes lane 1 and is the normal driving lane. Use it. \\n\\n*Merging. At a merge point, the car merging in does not need to indicate. The vehicle position and the lack of else where to go is your indication. No one has implied priority at a merge, don\\u2019t be a bellend of a driver and block people correctly merging so that you can be 1 car ahead. \\n\\n*Your horn is not to reprimand drivers for annoying you or cutting you up. It\\u2019s to alert them of your presence to avoid a collision. \\n\\n*Flashing your lights to let people go. I\\u2019ve seen this a lot across the UK and I did used to do it, too. However this is not what your lights or flashing is for. At least once a day in Glasgow I see a car flash someone to let them exit a junction etc and another car (or worse but often a pedestrian) will mistake the flash as being for them and the situation just gets messy.\\n\\n*Please understand NSL for different vehicles. NSL is set by vehicle type as well as road type. \\n\\n*If you are not going straight ahead at a roundabout, indicate on your approach to the roundabout. Don\\u2019t put your indicator on as you\\u2019re entering. Also, indicate off of the roundabout. Equally, don\\u2019t trust an indicator.\\n\\n*On a multilane carriage way, when you are returning to the left most lane where all lanes continue along the main carriageway, you do not need to indicate. I.e. Overtaking on the motorway or GWR in lane 2, when you\\u2019re returning to lane 1 once your overtake is completed, no indication is required. It is presumed you will return to the correct driving lane. (Note, it is not \\u201cslow lane\\u201d or \\u201cfast lane\\u201d either). Also, multiple lanes in either direction in the absence of a physical barrier does not mean dual carriage way (for NSL purposes).\\n\\n*Give learners space and expect them to be unpredictable. There\\u2019s many test routes along busy roads in Glasgow and often these are quite busy with learner drivers. Be patient. \\n\\nThese are just a few things I\\u2019ve noticed and more so recently.

I use a walking stick to help me with this. \\n\\nI\\u2019m unsure if the venue will let me keep my cane on me, as I\\u2019ve went once before years ago & they made me remove chains on my jeans & also took my water bottle. But I\\u2019m thinking for my cane it might be different because it\\u2019s genuinely for a medical condition. I\\u2019ve tried having a look online but I can\\u2019t seem to find anything for this specifically. \\n\\nThanks if anyone\\u2019s able to help me out! \", \"author\": \"Bless_this_mess_xo\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-18T11:26:41.352192\"}",

Any questions, please just ask.\\n\\nPrice is **\\u00a3190.**\\n\\nI'm selling my iPhone 12 Pro Max in Pacific Blue with 128GB of storage, having recently upgraded. It's a superb phone and I've loved using it for the last couple of years. Some more detailed information:\\n\\n**Cracked Back:** Unfortunately, the back glass is cracked. This is a common issue with the glass-backed iPhone models, but this does not affect the phone's functionality in any way whatsoever. The camera lenses are not damaged or affected in any way, and the LIDAR scanner also works perfectly despite there being a crack over it (tested). I would imagine that the phone will live in a case and as such, the damage is almost entirely invisible day-to-day.\\n\\n**Minor Screen Scratch:** There is one clearly visible scratch on the screen - please see photos for details. This isn't visible during use. There are very very small marks and scuffs that are barely visible to the naked eye, as to be expected with a phone of this age.\\n\\n**New Battery:** The battery was recently replaced with a new, high-quality third-party battery by iRepair in Battlefield, and is currently at 100% health.\\n\\nThe screen has never needed to have been replaced, and as such supports TrueTone. All switches, speakers and buttons work perfectly, as does the charging port. The front-facing camera and Face ID work perfectly, as does the MagSafe functionality. Wiped and upgraded to the latest iOS 26, released last week.\\n\\nIt's always been inside a case and has had a screen protector fitted throughout my ownership of it. I've taken the protector off to take these photos, and will include a brand new one for the next owner to fit. Also included is a grey silicone case.\\n\\nCash on collection only please.

One of them suddenly rushed forward trying to grab my bag. He failed the first time\\u2014probably because the order was bulky\\u2014so he got angry, lunged again, pulled a flatbread out, and threw it on the ground. Then he started shoving me and making threats. My adrenaline kicked in and I pushed back, but they were clearly much taller and stronger than me.\\n\\nAt that moment, a woman from the restaurant and a couple waiting in line rushed out. They told me to get inside and stood between me and those men until they backed off. They were incredibly brave\\u2014the guys were built and looked unhinged\\u2014but they didn\\u2019t hesitate to step in. I really can\\u2019t thank them enough.\\n\\nI do food delivery because I love traveling, and the job gives me freedom to choose my hours. But it comes with risks: I\\u2019ve been harassed by teenagers, yelled at by drunk people, and sometimes faced racist comments telling me to \\u201cgo back to China.\\u201d Those moments hurt. I\\u2019ve paid \\u00a34,000 for the NHS surcharge, plus visa fees and insurance, and I also pay taxes on my earnings. After every shift I disinfect my delivery bag. I\\u2019ve never harmed anyone. I left a decent job in China to come to Glasgow and support my partner during their PhD. Once it\\u2019s finished, I\\u2019ll return home.\\n\\nThe world is complex. I\\u2019ve completed over 2,000 deliveries and have never once had a rude customer\\u2014everyone has been polite and friendly. And every time something like that happens on the street, someone always comes quickly to help me.
