I know that posts about the standards of driving here are common but this week I feel the need to reiterate some points to both Glasgow born van drivers, and newer Glaswegians on our roads, speaking purely as an emergency response driver and someone who's car was written off with my child in the car on Thursday by a weegie in a van, nice enough bloke but only had his licence back a year.....\\n\\nFilter lanes: if you need to make a right turn and enter a filter lane without a light on a major road, you wait until the oncoming lane is clear before you enter it. Especially if a vehicle is directly beside you and crossing the line to make progress before you commence your turn. Get off your fucking phone/open your eyes/wait that extra second vs deciding to ram into the side of a vehicle who has right of way who thought because you'd stopped on approach that you knew how to drive.\\n\\nVehicle size: Know your driving abilities. I see some absolute shambles with people in big motors hesitating with spaces a bus can get through blocking traffic, people who canni do a 3 point turn, reverse out a parking space etc. It's like driving in fucking Nairobi doing the school run these days and gives me palpitations. The dings on the cars tell their own story. If you aren't a confident driver, learn on a wee car like we all fucking did, and usually a banger for that very reason. I shouldn't see P plates on a range rover or an x5.\\n\\nFilter lanes MK2 for our international drivers etc: if you have 3 lanes and wish to enter the right hand lane to turn right, please join the queue to do so like everyone else. Do not proceed up the middle lane to go straight ahead then decide to turn right at the junction and proceed in front of other vehicles who are driving legally and almost causing a collision. If you decide to do so, do not then take umbrage at horns making you aware of other drivers positions and decide to stop completely further up the road to become an obstruction blocking them, waving your wee hands etc to have a tantrum. You may, one day come across the wrong person (or when theor child isnt in the car) who decides to get out and educate you in an aroused manner. \\n\\nFinal point: if you do indeed do both these things, do not then decide to pull over and allow the previously aroused but now calm driver to pass you so that you can tailgate them home in an intimidating manner for 10 minutes just because you've been beeped. When they get out of their car at the lights to speak to you with a wave and a smile (was genuinely only wanting to educate you on the filter lane to avoid you getting any more grief), the least you could do is remain as you are and take the helpful advice rather than turn in a dangerous manouvre and fuck off. If you're going to tailgate someone for 10 minutes it kinda gives the impression that you have something to discuss and abandoning the conversation just creates extreme disappointment when all the foreplay leads to nothing. This isn't Kabul and you aren't in an ambush. So stop driving like you are and have some manners. \\n\\nWho the fuck is teaching these people to drive? I can ignore most poor manouvres and ill judged decisions made with good intentions when a blue light is behind you (though that is also quite a straight forward thought process tbh) but when I'm in my own car I see some absolute lizard level driving. It has definately gotten worse in the last 5 years. I enjoy driving but there are some absolute mutants on the road atm!\\n\\nRant over.

This is a complex one but I'll condense it the best I can. \\n\\nLong story short, she is ending/has ended a tenancy in sheltered housing due to a mouse problem. She left last night. She was set to move in with a friend's brother yesterday, but after realising the situation isn't safe for her (he smokes a lot of weed and apparently goes mental now and again) is now not moving in and has nowhere else to go. We are unsure if she is able to return to the sheltered housing - the tenancy may technically still be hers right now (she emailed them to let them know she was leaving with immediate effect but tenancies generally don't work like that) but she is refusing to stay there and we don't know if she has returned the keys. \\n\\nShe is unable to stay with us and she has no other family in the UK and very few friends. We have paid for a hotel room in the city centre until Tuesday and after this she is on her own.\\n\\nWe have given her the number for the council weekend homeless line and signposted her to the Simon Community incase they are able to help or give advice, however she has essentially made herself homeless and may technically still have a tenancy so are aware she would likely not qualify for any support. We have also offered to pay for a flight to her home country as she would have somewhere to stay there for a while but has flat out refused. She is stubborn to the point where we think she would genuinely rather sleep on the streets than return to her home country for a while.\\n\\nSo far she has refused to phone the council and does not want to visit the Simon Community today or possibly ever as she has a history of refusing support. She was offered to stay with a neighbour for a few days which she turned down, and had the potential to stay with the friend who's brother smokes weed but has also turned this down. \\n\\nJust reaching out to see if anyone has any other advice we can give to her before we step away from the situation - unstable housing/making bad decisions around housing/going homeless has been an ongoing cycle for her for years and we are done. She is on jobseekers and housing benefit which would make finding a flat/flatshare more difficult. \\n\\nAgain, I'm aware that because she has essentially made herself homeless she might not be eligible for any help anywhere but it never hurts to ask. I am a literal support worker so I have a semi-decent knowledge of support services to signpost to and even I'm stumped as to what to do with her. \\n\\nIf anyone has any idea as to what on earth to do here please leave a comment l, this is the last ditch at offering her advice before she truly has to do it on her own.

The follow Glasgow Times article is from 15 August explaining the changes: https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/25394636.changes-spt-cut-price-rail-travel-scheme-revealed/\\n\\nHowever, when you look at SPT\\u2019s website (which is where most people would go to check it especially if you\\u2019re not a Glasgow resident) , it hasn\\u2019t been updated and it still says that you get 50% off a standard fare: https://www.spt.co.uk/about-us/news/strathclyde-concessionary-travel-scheme-fare-changes-from-1-april-2025/\\n\\nThis is, once again, a major change that SPT haven\\u2019t bothered to communicate properly to NEC pass holders. It feels grossly unfair that we\\u2019ve not been able to fully benefit from the scrapping of peak fares.

The same account, while reposting a video which purported to show asylum seekers fighting in Spain, commented \\u201cgas them all\\u201d \\u2014 a phrase used on another, this time deleted, video.\\n\\nNow, The Bell can reveal that a north Glasgow man called Kieran Logan is behind the X account and the Tartan Team\\u2019s fundraiser. He\\u2019s also behind a Facebook profile which left the following comment on a post about the flags: \\u201cTime for a stand people if you want involved in the movement give me a message and I\\u2019ll get you flags sorted or if you need help getting your flag up.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\nThe comment finished by saying \\u201ctime to look after our own not everyone else\\u201d. Other users then made requests of Logan to fly flags in their area.\\u00a0\\n\\nWe contacted Kieran Logan via the same Facebook account. He responded saying \\u201cyou have the wrong Kieran\\u201d. However, The Bell was able to link two other X accounts that Logan tagged regularly to two profiles in his Facebook friend list. The profile images from the X accounts matched his friends\\u2019 Facebook profiles. It was this Kieran Logan who made the above comment.\\n\\nOver the week, we debated whether or not to name Kieran Logan. On Monday, we didn\\u2019t, as we were still working to fully confirm his identity. Now, given how prominent the flags are across north Glasgow, and that many interpret them as a symbol of independence, we believe our readers will want to know who\\u2019s been getting behind this emerging movement, which appears to be growing.\\n\\n# Tartan contradictions\\n\\nWhen we messaged the Tartan Team on Monday, they said that \\u201cimmigration is not a problem\\u201d for them. Instead, on their Facebook page, the Tartan Team say the flags are a \\u201cstand against politicians and councillors\\u201d who have gone \\u201cquiet\\u201d on issues the city is facing. These include NHS struggles, drug deaths, cost of living, mental health, and a housing crisis.\\u00a0\\n\\nTo them, Glasgow being one of the UK\\u2019s main dispersal cities for asylum seekers and, in their words, Westminster having \\u201cfailed to give funding to facilitate this\\u201d, is what is causing division. They also acknowledge that Scotland \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t be the country we are\\u201d without immigration.\\u00a0\\n\\nYesterday, off the back of growing support, the group announced that they plan to help the elderly, disabled people, and the homeless with essentials as the colder months approach, and that any new donations to them will go towards those causes.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\nYet that comes alongside the anti-immigration rhetoric from some of their followers whom they\\u2019ve engaged with. While there is no indication that any other member of the Tartan Team shares Logan\\u2019s views on gassing asylum seekers or spreading Nazi propaganda, it\\u2019s notable that the group\\u2019s TikTok account has liked several inflammatory comments on their videos. This includes a comment that says Milton is \\u201cfull\\u201d of immigrants and that young migrant men are \\u201cpraying \\\\[sic\\\\]\\u201d on women, and another that refers to migrants as \\u201cbeasts\\u201d.\\u00a0\\n\\n# \\u2018Masquerading as patriotism\\u2019\\n\\nMuch of the discussion locally about the flags going up is about what the saltire represents and who gets to decide what it means. On Monday, we heard from Maryhill resident Laurie Goldie, who set up an online petition to \\u201cchange the narrative\\u201d of the flags and oppose \\u201cracism, xenophobia, and hate in all forms\\u201d.\\n\\nIn a\\u00a0[widely-shared video](https://fb.watch/C44078w_Bq/?ref=glasgowbell.co.uk), Father Jim Lawlor of the Immaculate Conception Catholic church in Maryhill, said that the flags are \\u201cmasquerading as patriotism and nationalism, but it\\u2019s on the back of something far more sinister\\u201d.\", \"author\": \"Buachaille\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-13T09:38:24.776850\"}",

    "1njjqjo": "{\"text\": \"Driving in Glasgow - some observations. Feel free to comment as some of these may be controversial, but I don\\u2019t think they are. Some are generic to driving.\\n\\n*Glasgow has many bus lanes/gates. However, a good amount of these are only operational during peak times and the operational times are quite clearly displayed. Outwith the specified times, the \\u201cbus lane\\u201d becomes lane 1 and is the normal driving lane. Use it. \\n\\n*Merging. At a merge point, the car merging in does not need to indicate. The vehicle position and the lack of else where to go is your indication. No one has implied priority at a merge, don\\u2019t be a bellend of a driver and block people correctly merging so that you can be 1 car ahead. \\n\\n*Your horn is not to reprimand drivers for annoying you or cutting you up. It\\u2019s to alert them of your presence to avoid a collision. \\n\\n*Flashing your lights to let people go. I\\u2019ve seen this a lot across the UK and I did used to do it, too. However this is not what your lights or flashing is for. At least once a day in Glasgow I see a car flash someone to let them exit a junction etc and another car (or worse but often a pedestrian) will mistake the flash as being for them and the situation just gets messy.\\n\\n*Please understand NSL for different vehicles. NSL is set by vehicle type as well as road type. \\n\\n*If you are not going straight ahead at a roundabout, indicate on your approach to the roundabout. Don\\u2019t put your indicator on as you\\u2019re entering. Also, indicate off of the roundabout. Equally, don\\u2019t trust an indicator.\\n\\n*On a multilane carriage way, when you are returning to the left most lane where all lanes continue along the main carriageway, you do not need to indicate. I.e. Overtaking on the motorway or GWR in lane 2, when you\\u2019re returning to lane 1 once your overtake is completed, no indication is required. It is presumed you will return to the correct driving lane. (Note, it is not \\u201cslow lane\\u201d or \\u201cfast lane\\u201d either). Also, multiple lanes in either direction in the absence of a physical barrier does not mean dual carriage way (for NSL purposes).\\n\\n*Give learners space and expect them to be unpredictable. There\\u2019s many test routes along busy roads in Glasgow and often these are quite busy with learner drivers. Be patient. \\n\\nThese are just a few things I\\u2019ve noticed and more so recently.

I use a walking stick to help me with this. \\n\\nI\\u2019m unsure if the venue will let me keep my cane on me, as I\\u2019ve went once before years ago & they made me remove chains on my jeans & also took my water bottle. But I\\u2019m thinking for my cane it might be different because it\\u2019s genuinely for a medical condition. I\\u2019ve tried having a look online but I can\\u2019t seem to find anything for this specifically. \\n\\nThanks if anyone\\u2019s able to help me out! \", \"author\": \"Bless_this_mess_xo\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-18T11:26:41.352192\"}",

Any questions, please just ask.\\n\\nPrice is **\\u00a3190.**\\n\\nI'm selling my iPhone 12 Pro Max in Pacific Blue with 128GB of storage, having recently upgraded. It's a superb phone and I've loved using it for the last couple of years. Some more detailed information:\\n\\n**Cracked Back:** Unfortunately, the back glass is cracked. This is a common issue with the glass-backed iPhone models, but this does not affect the phone's functionality in any way whatsoever. The camera lenses are not damaged or affected in any way, and the LIDAR scanner also works perfectly despite there being a crack over it (tested). I would imagine that the phone will live in a case and as such, the damage is almost entirely invisible day-to-day.\\n\\n**Minor Screen Scratch:** There is one clearly visible scratch on the screen - please see photos for details. This isn't visible during use. There are very very small marks and scuffs that are barely visible to the naked eye, as to be expected with a phone of this age.\\n\\n**New Battery:** The battery was recently replaced with a new, high-quality third-party battery by iRepair in Battlefield, and is currently at 100% health.\\n\\nThe screen has never needed to have been replaced, and as such supports TrueTone. All switches, speakers and buttons work perfectly, as does the charging port. The front-facing camera and Face ID work perfectly, as does the MagSafe functionality. Wiped and upgraded to the latest iOS 26, released last week.\\n\\nIt's always been inside a case and has had a screen protector fitted throughout my ownership of it. I've taken the protector off to take these photos, and will include a brand new one for the next owner to fit. Also included is a grey silicone case.\\n\\nCash on collection only please.

One of them suddenly rushed forward trying to grab my bag. He failed the first time\\u2014probably because the order was bulky\\u2014so he got angry, lunged again, pulled a flatbread out, and threw it on the ground. Then he started shoving me and making threats. My adrenaline kicked in and I pushed back, but they were clearly much taller and stronger than me.\\n\\nAt that moment, a woman from the restaurant and a couple waiting in line rushed out. They told me to get inside and stood between me and those men until they backed off. They were incredibly brave\\u2014the guys were built and looked unhinged\\u2014but they didn\\u2019t hesitate to step in. I really can\\u2019t thank them enough.\\n\\nI do food delivery because I love traveling, and the job gives me freedom to choose my hours. But it comes with risks: I\\u2019ve been harassed by teenagers, yelled at by drunk people, and sometimes faced racist comments telling me to \\u201cgo back to China.\\u201d Those moments hurt. I\\u2019ve paid \\u00a34,000 for the NHS surcharge, plus visa fees and insurance, and I also pay taxes on my earnings. After every shift I disinfect my delivery bag. I\\u2019ve never harmed anyone. I left a decent job in China to come to Glasgow and support my partner during their PhD. Once it\\u2019s finished, I\\u2019ll return home.\\n\\nThe world is complex. I\\u2019ve completed over 2,000 deliveries and have never once had a rude customer\\u2014everyone has been polite and friendly. And every time something like that happens on the street, someone always comes quickly to help me.

And then I discovered the playwright herself is a nurse at the NHS so I knew I was getting something authentic and relatable for myself.  \\n  \\n  \\nIt\\u2019s been eleven years since I went and saw a play at The Tron Theatre. That at the time was an adaptation of Three Sisters with Sylvester McCoy starring. It was part of a writers lab attached to the theatre, but since then I\\u2019ve not had the chance to return. But with a more enthusiastic mindset towards the stage, this was a good show to make a return to the tron too. It\\u2019s a nice space and holds a lot of room for productions to create and manoeuvre around. It\\u2019s also very affordable too.  \\n  \\n  \\nThe play itself is a real eye opener into the crumbling state of our NHS, littered with characters that tap into all the problems with the organisation as well as their own angst and issues that are hinted at throughout the play. It\\u2019s at times dramatic and funny. The play has a cast of six, with some of the actors playing multiple roles and they work round and with each other very well. At the centre is Senior Charge Nurse Crea, played by Helen Logan, whose a very seasoned and experienced nurse whose desperately trying to keep her ward afloat, with the recurring motif of a broken ceiling that is all but ready to come crashing down. Logan is spot on at capturing Crea\\u2019s seasoned leadership with moments of vulnerability hidden away from her staff albeit one. Junior to her is nurse Ani played by Dani Heron. What I love about Heron\\u2019s performance is her exhaustion of the role even if she\\u2019s still relatively young herself. I can relate to seeing that in various nurses in my experience with the NHS. Watching them arrive so bright, so enthusiastic, so eager to learn with all the joy and encouragement and education from those years at university, all slowly sucked away three, four, five, six months into the post. Yet her arc through the play is one of sheer moral conflict. It ties in with a pallative patient played by Beruce Khan, whose a man with regret over a fragile relationship with his son and whose time in this world is drawing to a close. It forces Ami to be in a dilemma I can only imagine many nurses have been in numerous times in their career.  \\n  \\n  \\nYou\\u2019ve then got the supporting cast who are playing multiple roles in the play and thus are forced to switch their acting chops up many times in the duration of the drama. Martin Docherty plays mainly two characters. Billy, a porter whose observance at the nurses\\u2019s strain on the ward builds up a sincere sweet relationship with Crea, a will they won\\u2019t they situation which while nice is nothing I\\u2019ve personally seen in my job and could result in some serious trouble for those involved. His dual role is Mr Turnbull, an NHS patient with a very peculiar injury which is the first major comedy beat in the play. His role is the main cynical criticism and anger of the state of the NHS which Crea is quick to brush off whilst treating his situation. He lingers around the hospital, nursing his wound and ends up having a hilarious but subtly politically charge hallucination of a grim future of the NHS if it falls into the wrong hands. Funny but a sequence riddled with truth. Next is Betty Valencia who plays the dual roles of Lina and Isla. Lina is a student nurse arriving on the ward with all the enthusiasm of the job, but one with a reputation of being inept and out of her depth regarding caring for patients and being more of a burden than an assistance to the nurses. It\\u2019s a somewhat sad little character to watch but a reminder of how much student nurses can at times be dropped into very scary situations they cannot control nor understand. Her dual role is Isla, a young patient with suspicious burns to herself which slowly get revealed over the course of the play and leads to a grim ending as a result. Betty Valencia is excellent at both roles as they are polar opposite characters to portray. One heightened, rushing around, eager to please but a lot of attitude, where as the other is quiet and relaxed and guarding so much about herself. Props to her for balancing both. Finally there\\u2019s Ann Louise Ross playing Tersia, a patient confused and sick and is mainly the comic relief of being an in-patient causing mischief. One hilarious sequence involves her going to the toilet in a very inappropriate place, but one that got a huge cackle across the audience.  \\n  \\n  \\nThe technicals are fine. Convincing costumes, effective lighting and set design, and a good use of the space without losing sense of the story. Gareth Nicholls directs an effective piece by Uma Nada-Rajah, a NHS nurse herself who writes as close to an autobiographic story of the struggle, the strain and desperation of the NHS staff and patients who are slowly on board the collapse of one of the most precious institutions this country has ever had. Whilst the dialogue has some ropey moments, it\\u2019s still very real with a lot of NHS references and wording that I\\u2019ve overheard in my job as well as a familiar layout of a hospital ward which I\\u2019ve seen myself in my job role.  \\n  \\n  \\nIt\\u2019s currently playing at The Tron Theatre in Glasgow until The 4th of October, before moving to the Traverse Theatre for a ten-day run from the 8th to the 18th October. If you\\u2019re in the area around those times, it\\u2019s worth a watch and I\\u2019ve no doubt tickets will be available. It\\u2019s effective, relatable and local. The type of story that taps into a serious picture of our health service and its potential grim future if something serious isn\\u2019t done about it.  \\n  \\n  \\n**3.5 / 5 Stars**\", \"author\": \"macgregorc93\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-27T18:42:38.421313\"}",

I've now mapped nearly all of the cases from the 1980s that Police Scotland list as unresolved.\\n\\nOnce again, there are masses of detail available online on some cases, and next to nothing on others. This time around there have been a lot more cases I couldn't find any details on at all - 11 in total, which I'll link to this post in the hope someone out there might have some details.\\n\\nAs per the previous two decades, the vast majority of the cases are in Glasgow and the West.\\n\\nIn the 1970s there was a pattern of unidentified babies being found abandoned (apparently most often by their mothers), in the 1980s the pattern is instead fathers killing much older children (and themselves). The contemporary reporting talks of desperation, and without wanting to try and justify such acts, it is a theme that runs through the 1980s. A lot of these crimes occur outwith the city, in old industrial towns and the rural periphery. The 1980s were probably the last decade where Scotland is truly unrecognisable from today; a grey, bleak, largely ignored place.\\n\\nI noted before that crime wise the 1960s were bad and the 1970s even worse - the 1980s is again by degrees worse - I'll post a trigger warning just now, there are some horrible, sordid details in many of these crimes.\\n\\nOrange markers on the map are Unresolved murders (ie. no one has ever been convicted), while those marked in dark red are Undetected (ie. police have never identified a viable suspect).\\n\\n[https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1G7333vKA7Mu6Z7A2\\\\_i0FsXbpip42btc&usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1G7333vKA7Mu6Z7A2_i0FsXbpip42btc&usp=sharing)\\n\\nBelow is the link to a map that also includes the 1960s (green markers) and 1970s (yellow markers).

Also curious as I've been asked for postcode and id a few times at Queenslie so would interesting if they're scrapping that at the other places for the time being.\\n\\nWe were considering a garden service with waste removal anyway next year as work is keeping us busy but seems like with the Queenslie Dump shutting that's probably the best option for now.\", \"author\": \"Inside-Reaction-5929\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-10-04T13:36:57.432031\"}",

Honestly, why is there so much litter everywhere, I see people just throwing their rubbish on the streets when there\\u2019s bins 10-20 feet ahead of them. Do they just not care about their country? Is this a cultural problem and where does it stem from? From someone who went to school in a different country, does the UK school system not teach people the effects of littering on the environment?\\nAlso are there not enough city cleaners? I just don\\u2019t understand.. I was born in Glasgow but lived basically my whole life in another country and have recently come back and am shocked to see how some people treat their own country so poorly. It\\u2019s a shame because Scotland is so beautiful but these people just make the city look like a dump :/ not trying to sh*t on the country but I hate how people don\\u2019t care \", \"author\": \"lilminiaturewayne\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-10-04T13:49:43.076324\"}",
