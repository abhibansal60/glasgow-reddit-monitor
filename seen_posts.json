I know that posts about the standards of driving here are common but this week I feel the need to reiterate some points to both Glasgow born van drivers, and newer Glaswegians on our roads, speaking purely as an emergency response driver and someone who's car was written off with my child in the car on Thursday by a weegie in a van, nice enough bloke but only had his licence back a year.....\\n\\nFilter lanes: if you need to make a right turn and enter a filter lane without a light on a major road, you wait until the oncoming lane is clear before you enter it. Especially if a vehicle is directly beside you and crossing the line to make progress before you commence your turn. Get off your fucking phone/open your eyes/wait that extra second vs deciding to ram into the side of a vehicle who has right of way who thought because you'd stopped on approach that you knew how to drive.\\n\\nVehicle size: Know your driving abilities. I see some absolute shambles with people in big motors hesitating with spaces a bus can get through blocking traffic, people who canni do a 3 point turn, reverse out a parking space etc. It's like driving in fucking Nairobi doing the school run these days and gives me palpitations. The dings on the cars tell their own story. If you aren't a confident driver, learn on a wee car like we all fucking did, and usually a banger for that very reason. I shouldn't see P plates on a range rover or an x5.\\n\\nFilter lanes MK2 for our international drivers etc: if you have 3 lanes and wish to enter the right hand lane to turn right, please join the queue to do so like everyone else. Do not proceed up the middle lane to go straight ahead then decide to turn right at the junction and proceed in front of other vehicles who are driving legally and almost causing a collision. If you decide to do so, do not then take umbrage at horns making you aware of other drivers positions and decide to stop completely further up the road to become an obstruction blocking them, waving your wee hands etc to have a tantrum. You may, one day come across the wrong person (or when theor child isnt in the car) who decides to get out and educate you in an aroused manner. \\n\\nFinal point: if you do indeed do both these things, do not then decide to pull over and allow the previously aroused but now calm driver to pass you so that you can tailgate them home in an intimidating manner for 10 minutes just because you've been beeped. When they get out of their car at the lights to speak to you with a wave and a smile (was genuinely only wanting to educate you on the filter lane to avoid you getting any more grief), the least you could do is remain as you are and take the helpful advice rather than turn in a dangerous manouvre and fuck off. If you're going to tailgate someone for 10 minutes it kinda gives the impression that you have something to discuss and abandoning the conversation just creates extreme disappointment when all the foreplay leads to nothing. This isn't Kabul and you aren't in an ambush. So stop driving like you are and have some manners. \\n\\nWho the fuck is teaching these people to drive? I can ignore most poor manouvres and ill judged decisions made with good intentions when a blue light is behind you (though that is also quite a straight forward thought process tbh) but when I'm in my own car I see some absolute lizard level driving. It has definately gotten worse in the last 5 years. I enjoy driving but there are some absolute mutants on the road atm!\\n\\nRant over.

This is a complex one but I'll condense it the best I can. \\n\\nLong story short, she is ending/has ended a tenancy in sheltered housing due to a mouse problem. She left last night. She was set to move in with a friend's brother yesterday, but after realising the situation isn't safe for her (he smokes a lot of weed and apparently goes mental now and again) is now not moving in and has nowhere else to go. We are unsure if she is able to return to the sheltered housing - the tenancy may technically still be hers right now (she emailed them to let them know she was leaving with immediate effect but tenancies generally don't work like that) but she is refusing to stay there and we don't know if she has returned the keys. \\n\\nShe is unable to stay with us and she has no other family in the UK and very few friends. We have paid for a hotel room in the city centre until Tuesday and after this she is on her own.\\n\\nWe have given her the number for the council weekend homeless line and signposted her to the Simon Community incase they are able to help or give advice, however she has essentially made herself homeless and may technically still have a tenancy so are aware she would likely not qualify for any support. We have also offered to pay for a flight to her home country as she would have somewhere to stay there for a while but has flat out refused. She is stubborn to the point where we think she would genuinely rather sleep on the streets than return to her home country for a while.\\n\\nSo far she has refused to phone the council and does not want to visit the Simon Community today or possibly ever as she has a history of refusing support. She was offered to stay with a neighbour for a few days which she turned down, and had the potential to stay with the friend who's brother smokes weed but has also turned this down. \\n\\nJust reaching out to see if anyone has any other advice we can give to her before we step away from the situation - unstable housing/making bad decisions around housing/going homeless has been an ongoing cycle for her for years and we are done. She is on jobseekers and housing benefit which would make finding a flat/flatshare more difficult. \\n\\nAgain, I'm aware that because she has essentially made herself homeless she might not be eligible for any help anywhere but it never hurts to ask. I am a literal support worker so I have a semi-decent knowledge of support services to signpost to and even I'm stumped as to what to do with her. \\n\\nIf anyone has any idea as to what on earth to do here please leave a comment l, this is the last ditch at offering her advice before she truly has to do it on her own.
