I know that posts about the standards of driving here are common but this week I feel the need to reiterate some points to both Glasgow born van drivers, and newer Glaswegians on our roads, speaking purely as an emergency response driver and someone who's car was written off with my child in the car on Thursday by a weegie in a van, nice enough bloke but only had his licence back a year.....\\n\\nFilter lanes: if you need to make a right turn and enter a filter lane without a light on a major road, you wait until the oncoming lane is clear before you enter it. Especially if a vehicle is directly beside you and crossing the line to make progress before you commence your turn. Get off your fucking phone/open your eyes/wait that extra second vs deciding to ram into the side of a vehicle who has right of way who thought because you'd stopped on approach that you knew how to drive.\\n\\nVehicle size: Know your driving abilities. I see some absolute shambles with people in big motors hesitating with spaces a bus can get through blocking traffic, people who canni do a 3 point turn, reverse out a parking space etc. It's like driving in fucking Nairobi doing the school run these days and gives me palpitations. The dings on the cars tell their own story. If you aren't a confident driver, learn on a wee car like we all fucking did, and usually a banger for that very reason. I shouldn't see P plates on a range rover or an x5.\\n\\nFilter lanes MK2 for our international drivers etc: if you have 3 lanes and wish to enter the right hand lane to turn right, please join the queue to do so like everyone else. Do not proceed up the middle lane to go straight ahead then decide to turn right at the junction and proceed in front of other vehicles who are driving legally and almost causing a collision. If you decide to do so, do not then take umbrage at horns making you aware of other drivers positions and decide to stop completely further up the road to become an obstruction blocking them, waving your wee hands etc to have a tantrum. You may, one day come across the wrong person (or when theor child isnt in the car) who decides to get out and educate you in an aroused manner. \\n\\nFinal point: if you do indeed do both these things, do not then decide to pull over and allow the previously aroused but now calm driver to pass you so that you can tailgate them home in an intimidating manner for 10 minutes just because you've been beeped. When they get out of their car at the lights to speak to you with a wave and a smile (was genuinely only wanting to educate you on the filter lane to avoid you getting any more grief), the least you could do is remain as you are and take the helpful advice rather than turn in a dangerous manouvre and fuck off. If you're going to tailgate someone for 10 minutes it kinda gives the impression that you have something to discuss and abandoning the conversation just creates extreme disappointment when all the foreplay leads to nothing. This isn't Kabul and you aren't in an ambush. So stop driving like you are and have some manners. \\n\\nWho the fuck is teaching these people to drive? I can ignore most poor manouvres and ill judged decisions made with good intentions when a blue light is behind you (though that is also quite a straight forward thought process tbh) but when I'm in my own car I see some absolute lizard level driving. It has definately gotten worse in the last 5 years. I enjoy driving but there are some absolute mutants on the road atm!\\n\\nRant over.

This is a complex one but I'll condense it the best I can. \\n\\nLong story short, she is ending/has ended a tenancy in sheltered housing due to a mouse problem. She left last night. She was set to move in with a friend's brother yesterday, but after realising the situation isn't safe for her (he smokes a lot of weed and apparently goes mental now and again) is now not moving in and has nowhere else to go. We are unsure if she is able to return to the sheltered housing - the tenancy may technically still be hers right now (she emailed them to let them know she was leaving with immediate effect but tenancies generally don't work like that) but she is refusing to stay there and we don't know if she has returned the keys. \\n\\nShe is unable to stay with us and she has no other family in the UK and very few friends. We have paid for a hotel room in the city centre until Tuesday and after this she is on her own.\\n\\nWe have given her the number for the council weekend homeless line and signposted her to the Simon Community incase they are able to help or give advice, however she has essentially made herself homeless and may technically still have a tenancy so are aware she would likely not qualify for any support. We have also offered to pay for a flight to her home country as she would have somewhere to stay there for a while but has flat out refused. She is stubborn to the point where we think she would genuinely rather sleep on the streets than return to her home country for a while.\\n\\nSo far she has refused to phone the council and does not want to visit the Simon Community today or possibly ever as she has a history of refusing support. She was offered to stay with a neighbour for a few days which she turned down, and had the potential to stay with the friend who's brother smokes weed but has also turned this down. \\n\\nJust reaching out to see if anyone has any other advice we can give to her before we step away from the situation - unstable housing/making bad decisions around housing/going homeless has been an ongoing cycle for her for years and we are done. She is on jobseekers and housing benefit which would make finding a flat/flatshare more difficult. \\n\\nAgain, I'm aware that because she has essentially made herself homeless she might not be eligible for any help anywhere but it never hurts to ask. I am a literal support worker so I have a semi-decent knowledge of support services to signpost to and even I'm stumped as to what to do with her. \\n\\nIf anyone has any idea as to what on earth to do here please leave a comment l, this is the last ditch at offering her advice before she truly has to do it on her own.

The follow Glasgow Times article is from 15 August explaining the changes: https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/25394636.changes-spt-cut-price-rail-travel-scheme-revealed/\\n\\nHowever, when you look at SPT\\u2019s website (which is where most people would go to check it especially if you\\u2019re not a Glasgow resident) , it hasn\\u2019t been updated and it still says that you get 50% off a standard fare: https://www.spt.co.uk/about-us/news/strathclyde-concessionary-travel-scheme-fare-changes-from-1-april-2025/\\n\\nThis is, once again, a major change that SPT haven\\u2019t bothered to communicate properly to NEC pass holders. It feels grossly unfair that we\\u2019ve not been able to fully benefit from the scrapping of peak fares.

The same account, while reposting a video which purported to show asylum seekers fighting in Spain, commented \\u201cgas them all\\u201d \\u2014 a phrase used on another, this time deleted, video.\\n\\nNow, The Bell can reveal that a north Glasgow man called Kieran Logan is behind the X account and the Tartan Team\\u2019s fundraiser. He\\u2019s also behind a Facebook profile which left the following comment on a post about the flags: \\u201cTime for a stand people if you want involved in the movement give me a message and I\\u2019ll get you flags sorted or if you need help getting your flag up.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\nThe comment finished by saying \\u201ctime to look after our own not everyone else\\u201d. Other users then made requests of Logan to fly flags in their area.\\u00a0\\n\\nWe contacted Kieran Logan via the same Facebook account. He responded saying \\u201cyou have the wrong Kieran\\u201d. However, The Bell was able to link two other X accounts that Logan tagged regularly to two profiles in his Facebook friend list. The profile images from the X accounts matched his friends\\u2019 Facebook profiles. It was this Kieran Logan who made the above comment.\\n\\nOver the week, we debated whether or not to name Kieran Logan. On Monday, we didn\\u2019t, as we were still working to fully confirm his identity. Now, given how prominent the flags are across north Glasgow, and that many interpret them as a symbol of independence, we believe our readers will want to know who\\u2019s been getting behind this emerging movement, which appears to be growing.\\n\\n# Tartan contradictions\\n\\nWhen we messaged the Tartan Team on Monday, they said that \\u201cimmigration is not a problem\\u201d for them. Instead, on their Facebook page, the Tartan Team say the flags are a \\u201cstand against politicians and councillors\\u201d who have gone \\u201cquiet\\u201d on issues the city is facing. These include NHS struggles, drug deaths, cost of living, mental health, and a housing crisis.\\u00a0\\n\\nTo them, Glasgow being one of the UK\\u2019s main dispersal cities for asylum seekers and, in their words, Westminster having \\u201cfailed to give funding to facilitate this\\u201d, is what is causing division. They also acknowledge that Scotland \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t be the country we are\\u201d without immigration.\\u00a0\\n\\nYesterday, off the back of growing support, the group announced that they plan to help the elderly, disabled people, and the homeless with essentials as the colder months approach, and that any new donations to them will go towards those causes.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\nYet that comes alongside the anti-immigration rhetoric from some of their followers whom they\\u2019ve engaged with. While there is no indication that any other member of the Tartan Team shares Logan\\u2019s views on gassing asylum seekers or spreading Nazi propaganda, it\\u2019s notable that the group\\u2019s TikTok account has liked several inflammatory comments on their videos. This includes a comment that says Milton is \\u201cfull\\u201d of immigrants and that young migrant men are \\u201cpraying \\\\[sic\\\\]\\u201d on women, and another that refers to migrants as \\u201cbeasts\\u201d.\\u00a0\\n\\n# \\u2018Masquerading as patriotism\\u2019\\n\\nMuch of the discussion locally about the flags going up is about what the saltire represents and who gets to decide what it means. On Monday, we heard from Maryhill resident Laurie Goldie, who set up an online petition to \\u201cchange the narrative\\u201d of the flags and oppose \\u201cracism, xenophobia, and hate in all forms\\u201d.\\n\\nIn a\\u00a0[widely-shared video](https://fb.watch/C44078w_Bq/?ref=glasgowbell.co.uk), Father Jim Lawlor of the Immaculate Conception Catholic church in Maryhill, said that the flags are \\u201cmasquerading as patriotism and nationalism, but it\\u2019s on the back of something far more sinister\\u201d.\", \"author\": \"Buachaille\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-13T09:38:24.776850\"}",

    "1njjqjo": "{\"text\": \"Driving in Glasgow - some observations. Feel free to comment as some of these may be controversial, but I don\\u2019t think they are. Some are generic to driving.\\n\\n*Glasgow has many bus lanes/gates. However, a good amount of these are only operational during peak times and the operational times are quite clearly displayed. Outwith the specified times, the \\u201cbus lane\\u201d becomes lane 1 and is the normal driving lane. Use it. \\n\\n*Merging. At a merge point, the car merging in does not need to indicate. The vehicle position and the lack of else where to go is your indication. No one has implied priority at a merge, don\\u2019t be a bellend of a driver and block people correctly merging so that you can be 1 car ahead. \\n\\n*Your horn is not to reprimand drivers for annoying you or cutting you up. It\\u2019s to alert them of your presence to avoid a collision. \\n\\n*Flashing your lights to let people go. I\\u2019ve seen this a lot across the UK and I did used to do it, too. However this is not what your lights or flashing is for. At least once a day in Glasgow I see a car flash someone to let them exit a junction etc and another car (or worse but often a pedestrian) will mistake the flash as being for them and the situation just gets messy.\\n\\n*Please understand NSL for different vehicles. NSL is set by vehicle type as well as road type. \\n\\n*If you are not going straight ahead at a roundabout, indicate on your approach to the roundabout. Don\\u2019t put your indicator on as you\\u2019re entering. Also, indicate off of the roundabout. Equally, don\\u2019t trust an indicator.\\n\\n*On a multilane carriage way, when you are returning to the left most lane where all lanes continue along the main carriageway, you do not need to indicate. I.e. Overtaking on the motorway or GWR in lane 2, when you\\u2019re returning to lane 1 once your overtake is completed, no indication is required. It is presumed you will return to the correct driving lane. (Note, it is not \\u201cslow lane\\u201d or \\u201cfast lane\\u201d either). Also, multiple lanes in either direction in the absence of a physical barrier does not mean dual carriage way (for NSL purposes).\\n\\n*Give learners space and expect them to be unpredictable. There\\u2019s many test routes along busy roads in Glasgow and often these are quite busy with learner drivers. Be patient. \\n\\nThese are just a few things I\\u2019ve noticed and more so recently.

I use a walking stick to help me with this. \\n\\nI\\u2019m unsure if the venue will let me keep my cane on me, as I\\u2019ve went once before years ago & they made me remove chains on my jeans & also took my water bottle. But I\\u2019m thinking for my cane it might be different because it\\u2019s genuinely for a medical condition. I\\u2019ve tried having a look online but I can\\u2019t seem to find anything for this specifically. \\n\\nThanks if anyone\\u2019s able to help me out! \", \"author\": \"Bless_this_mess_xo\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-18T11:26:41.352192\"}",

Any questions, please just ask.\\n\\nPrice is **\\u00a3190.**\\n\\nI'm selling my iPhone 12 Pro Max in Pacific Blue with 128GB of storage, having recently upgraded. It's a superb phone and I've loved using it for the last couple of years. Some more detailed information:\\n\\n**Cracked Back:** Unfortunately, the back glass is cracked. This is a common issue with the glass-backed iPhone models, but this does not affect the phone's functionality in any way whatsoever. The camera lenses are not damaged or affected in any way, and the LIDAR scanner also works perfectly despite there being a crack over it (tested). I would imagine that the phone will live in a case and as such, the damage is almost entirely invisible day-to-day.\\n\\n**Minor Screen Scratch:** There is one clearly visible scratch on the screen - please see photos for details. This isn't visible during use. There are very very small marks and scuffs that are barely visible to the naked eye, as to be expected with a phone of this age.\\n\\n**New Battery:** The battery was recently replaced with a new, high-quality third-party battery by iRepair in Battlefield, and is currently at 100% health.\\n\\nThe screen has never needed to have been replaced, and as such supports TrueTone. All switches, speakers and buttons work perfectly, as does the charging port. The front-facing camera and Face ID work perfectly, as does the MagSafe functionality. Wiped and upgraded to the latest iOS 26, released last week.\\n\\nIt's always been inside a case and has had a screen protector fitted throughout my ownership of it. I've taken the protector off to take these photos, and will include a brand new one for the next owner to fit. Also included is a grey silicone case.\\n\\nCash on collection only please.

One of them suddenly rushed forward trying to grab my bag. He failed the first time\\u2014probably because the order was bulky\\u2014so he got angry, lunged again, pulled a flatbread out, and threw it on the ground. Then he started shoving me and making threats. My adrenaline kicked in and I pushed back, but they were clearly much taller and stronger than me.\\n\\nAt that moment, a woman from the restaurant and a couple waiting in line rushed out. They told me to get inside and stood between me and those men until they backed off. They were incredibly brave\\u2014the guys were built and looked unhinged\\u2014but they didn\\u2019t hesitate to step in. I really can\\u2019t thank them enough.\\n\\nI do food delivery because I love traveling, and the job gives me freedom to choose my hours. But it comes with risks: I\\u2019ve been harassed by teenagers, yelled at by drunk people, and sometimes faced racist comments telling me to \\u201cgo back to China.\\u201d Those moments hurt. I\\u2019ve paid \\u00a34,000 for the NHS surcharge, plus visa fees and insurance, and I also pay taxes on my earnings. After every shift I disinfect my delivery bag. I\\u2019ve never harmed anyone. I left a decent job in China to come to Glasgow and support my partner during their PhD. Once it\\u2019s finished, I\\u2019ll return home.\\n\\nThe world is complex. I\\u2019ve completed over 2,000 deliveries and have never once had a rude customer\\u2014everyone has been polite and friendly. And every time something like that happens on the street, someone always comes quickly to help me.

And then I discovered the playwright herself is a nurse at the NHS so I knew I was getting something authentic and relatable for myself.  \\n  \\n  \\nIt\\u2019s been eleven years since I went and saw a play at The Tron Theatre. That at the time was an adaptation of Three Sisters with Sylvester McCoy starring. It was part of a writers lab attached to the theatre, but since then I\\u2019ve not had the chance to return. But with a more enthusiastic mindset towards the stage, this was a good show to make a return to the tron too. It\\u2019s a nice space and holds a lot of room for productions to create and manoeuvre around. It\\u2019s also very affordable too.  \\n  \\n  \\nThe play itself is a real eye opener into the crumbling state of our NHS, littered with characters that tap into all the problems with the organisation as well as their own angst and issues that are hinted at throughout the play. It\\u2019s at times dramatic and funny. The play has a cast of six, with some of the actors playing multiple roles and they work round and with each other very well. At the centre is Senior Charge Nurse Crea, played by Helen Logan, whose a very seasoned and experienced nurse whose desperately trying to keep her ward afloat, with the recurring motif of a broken ceiling that is all but ready to come crashing down. Logan is spot on at capturing Crea\\u2019s seasoned leadership with moments of vulnerability hidden away from her staff albeit one. Junior to her is nurse Ani played by Dani Heron. What I love about Heron\\u2019s performance is her exhaustion of the role even if she\\u2019s still relatively young herself. I can relate to seeing that in various nurses in my experience with the NHS. Watching them arrive so bright, so enthusiastic, so eager to learn with all the joy and encouragement and education from those years at university, all slowly sucked away three, four, five, six months into the post. Yet her arc through the play is one of sheer moral conflict. It ties in with a pallative patient played by Beruce Khan, whose a man with regret over a fragile relationship with his son and whose time in this world is drawing to a close. It forces Ami to be in a dilemma I can only imagine many nurses have been in numerous times in their career.  \\n  \\n  \\nYou\\u2019ve then got the supporting cast who are playing multiple roles in the play and thus are forced to switch their acting chops up many times in the duration of the drama. Martin Docherty plays mainly two characters. Billy, a porter whose observance at the nurses\\u2019s strain on the ward builds up a sincere sweet relationship with Crea, a will they won\\u2019t they situation which while nice is nothing I\\u2019ve personally seen in my job and could result in some serious trouble for those involved. His dual role is Mr Turnbull, an NHS patient with a very peculiar injury which is the first major comedy beat in the play. His role is the main cynical criticism and anger of the state of the NHS which Crea is quick to brush off whilst treating his situation. He lingers around the hospital, nursing his wound and ends up having a hilarious but subtly politically charge hallucination of a grim future of the NHS if it falls into the wrong hands. Funny but a sequence riddled with truth. Next is Betty Valencia who plays the dual roles of Lina and Isla. Lina is a student nurse arriving on the ward with all the enthusiasm of the job, but one with a reputation of being inept and out of her depth regarding caring for patients and being more of a burden than an assistance to the nurses. It\\u2019s a somewhat sad little character to watch but a reminder of how much student nurses can at times be dropped into very scary situations they cannot control nor understand. Her dual role is Isla, a young patient with suspicious burns to herself which slowly get revealed over the course of the play and leads to a grim ending as a result. Betty Valencia is excellent at both roles as they are polar opposite characters to portray. One heightened, rushing around, eager to please but a lot of attitude, where as the other is quiet and relaxed and guarding so much about herself. Props to her for balancing both. Finally there\\u2019s Ann Louise Ross playing Tersia, a patient confused and sick and is mainly the comic relief of being an in-patient causing mischief. One hilarious sequence involves her going to the toilet in a very inappropriate place, but one that got a huge cackle across the audience.  \\n  \\n  \\nThe technicals are fine. Convincing costumes, effective lighting and set design, and a good use of the space without losing sense of the story. Gareth Nicholls directs an effective piece by Uma Nada-Rajah, a NHS nurse herself who writes as close to an autobiographic story of the struggle, the strain and desperation of the NHS staff and patients who are slowly on board the collapse of one of the most precious institutions this country has ever had. Whilst the dialogue has some ropey moments, it\\u2019s still very real with a lot of NHS references and wording that I\\u2019ve overheard in my job as well as a familiar layout of a hospital ward which I\\u2019ve seen myself in my job role.  \\n  \\n  \\nIt\\u2019s currently playing at The Tron Theatre in Glasgow until The 4th of October, before moving to the Traverse Theatre for a ten-day run from the 8th to the 18th October. If you\\u2019re in the area around those times, it\\u2019s worth a watch and I\\u2019ve no doubt tickets will be available. It\\u2019s effective, relatable and local. The type of story that taps into a serious picture of our health service and its potential grim future if something serious isn\\u2019t done about it.  \\n  \\n  \\n**3.5 / 5 Stars**\", \"author\": \"macgregorc93\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-27T18:42:38.421313\"}",

I've now mapped nearly all of the cases from the 1980s that Police Scotland list as unresolved.\\n\\nOnce again, there are masses of detail available online on some cases, and next to nothing on others. This time around there have been a lot more cases I couldn't find any details on at all - 11 in total, which I'll link to this post in the hope someone out there might have some details.\\n\\nAs per the previous two decades, the vast majority of the cases are in Glasgow and the West.\\n\\nIn the 1970s there was a pattern of unidentified babies being found abandoned (apparently most often by their mothers), in the 1980s the pattern is instead fathers killing much older children (and themselves). The contemporary reporting talks of desperation, and without wanting to try and justify such acts, it is a theme that runs through the 1980s. A lot of these crimes occur outwith the city, in old industrial towns and the rural periphery. The 1980s were probably the last decade where Scotland is truly unrecognisable from today; a grey, bleak, largely ignored place.\\n\\nI noted before that crime wise the 1960s were bad and the 1970s even worse - the 1980s is again by degrees worse - I'll post a trigger warning just now, there are some horrible, sordid details in many of these crimes.\\n\\nOrange markers on the map are Unresolved murders (ie. no one has ever been convicted), while those marked in dark red are Undetected (ie. police have never identified a viable suspect).\\n\\n[https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1G7333vKA7Mu6Z7A2\\\\_i0FsXbpip42btc&usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1G7333vKA7Mu6Z7A2_i0FsXbpip42btc&usp=sharing)\\n\\nBelow is the link to a map that also includes the 1960s (green markers) and 1970s (yellow markers).

I got in to Glasgow tonight after a couple of days in Edinburgh where I went to several gay and queer bars / nightclubs. \\n\\nTonight I decided to check out Katie's Bar since they were doing karaoke. I got there and it was packed with university students and not queer at all, so I headed to Delmonica's. Delmonica's drag show was amazing and I loved every minute of it. The bar closed immediately after the show ended and I wasn't ready to call it a night yet so I walked over to Polo Lounge. I saw the bouncers and figured they were checking IDs but instead they asked me if I knew anyone already inside the club. I explained that I was on vacation and traveling through Scotland solo. They then told me that I couldn't be let in because of company policy. I inquired further and they explained that since I was alone, they couldn't vouch for my safety, should something happen to me. \\n\\nI was so surprised, because I've literally never been turned away from a club, so I just walked away really stunned. My confusion stems from why do they think that being in a group means that you will be safe? People wander off from their friends all the time. If you're drunk, you're drunk; it doesn't matter if you're in a group or not. I'm further confused because one of the bouncers casually added that this policy is common among clubs in Glasgow and I'm like why am I being penalized for being a solo traveler? If they want to keep it just a locals club (where people can safely party with their friends), that's totally fine - just say that! But this excuse doesn't make any sense to me. I'm now concerned because I don't know if I can go anywhere else.\\n\\nCan anyone provide some perspective on this? I'm just truly baffled.

I moan about its flaws to other Glaswegians while fiercely defending it from the barbs of outsiders. I take pride in its achievements and mourn its losses. I laugh at its in-jokes. I feel its weariness in my bones.\\n\\nBut I wasn\\u2019t born in the city; I arrived in Glasgow\\u2019s West End at 17, fresh from the Ayrshire coast, hungry for adventure. And for nearly two decades, I haven\\u2019t lived in the city proper but, rather, a few hundred feet over the boundary, in a part of East Renfrewshire newspapers tend to describe as \\u201cleafy\\u201d, My council tax goes into different municipal coffers. \\n\\nThis contradiction is particularly problematic for a journalist. When I write pieces about Glasgow\\u2019s perceived decline, and the lack of funding that contributes to it, to what extent do I have to concede that I am part of the problem? And is it legitimate to claim a stake in a city I have effectively spurned? \\n\\nMy husband and I moved our family to Giffnock from Pollokshaws 18 years ago when our sons were aged 9, 7 and 3. We didn\\u2019t move specifically for East Renfrewshire\\u2019s feted state schools, but our sons benefited from their excellence. \\n\\nBut while taking advantage of East Renfrewshire\\u2019s schools, I have continued to rely on Glasgow for other services. I travel on the city\\u2019s roads, read in the Mitchell Library, spend afternoons in the Burrell and the Kelvingrove. I wander through its many parks, and my sons learned to swim in its swimming pools. Yet the arbitrary line across the bottom of our hill means however much we avail ourselves of its facilities, we\\u2019re not paying as much as we could towards their upkeep. \\n\\nMoving from the city made me feel conflicted in 2007. Now, with Glasgow on its knees \\u2014 its budget slashed and services raggedy \\u2014 my guilt grows, along, I sense, with the resentment of those who have remained on the city side of the boundary. \\n\\nWhat is the root of these tensions? Blame the 1994 Local Government (Scotland) Act. This was the piece of legislation which abolished Strathclyde Regional Council (and its district councils) and replaced them with 12 unitary authorities.\\n\\nSure the region was big and unwieldy. Stretching all the way from the Inner Hebrides to South Ayrshire, it covered 5,300 square miles and contained 2.3 million people, 45% of the Scottish population. But the motivation for scrapping it was political, an attempt to dilute what the former Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Lang described as \\u201cthe baleful shadow of socialism that stretches across the central belt\\u201d\\n\\nGlasgow\\u2019s population had already been affected by mid-20th-century policy decisions: the decanting of skilled workers out to the New Towns and tens of thousands of those who remained into peripheral \\u201coverspill\\u201d estates, like Pollok and Drumchapel, which quickly became synonyms for deprivation. \\n\\nThe drawing up of the 1994 boundaries was gerrymandered to make sure Glasgow held on to all those estates, while more affluent, and prospectively Conservative areas, were hived off to form the likes of East Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire. \\n\\nProfessor Iain Docherty, dean of advanced studies at Stirling University, grew up in Bishopbriggs with parents who \\u201cescaped a few hundred yards over the [East Dunbartonshire] boundary to buy their own house.\\u201d He wrote his undergraduate dissertation on the changes. \\u201cThere was all this bullshit being written about how areas like East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire had their own identities,\\u201d he says. \\u201cSo I went out to [those areas] to ask people questions about what they did and didn\\u2019t identify with, and of course it turned out they are just part of the city; everybody knows that.\\u201d \\n\\nThe act left Glasgow \\u2014 current population 635,100 \\u2014 with the twin problems of disproportionately high levels of poverty and a low council-tax base.  \\n\\nThis inequity is not lost on those who live on either side of the line. \\u201cI first started to think about it when I looked at the SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) map and noticed two protrusions at the Glasgow/East Renfrewshire boundary,\\u201d Thomas*, a 36-year-old public sector worker who lives in Mount Florida, tells me. \\n\\n\\u201cThe first keeps Giffnock, Williamwood and Netherlee on the East Renfrewshire side and Carnwadric and Arden on the Glasgow side. The second keeps Castlemilk in the city.\\u201d \\nThe SIMD map marks the most deprived areas in shades of red and the least deprived in shades of blue. Giffnock, Williamwood and Netherlee are all blue, while Carnwadric, Arden and Castlemilk are red. The boundary is also carefully drawn to divide the cheek-by-jowl communities of Drumchapel (red and part of Glasgow) and Bearsden (blue and part of East Dunbartonshire). \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very stark, Thomas says. \\u201cOnce you\\u2019ve seen it, you can\\u2019t unsee it.\\u201d \\n\\nIt\\u2019s unmistakable in the real world too. Here\\u2019s one glaring example: the playpark at Queen\\u2019s Park \\u2014 with its handful of rundown swings and roundabouts \\u2014 versus the playpark at Rouken Glen (East Renfrewshire, of course), with its giant ship and helter skelter, and maze of climbing frames and netting. This disparity exists even though most of the housing next to Queen\\u2019s Park is tenement flats, whereas Rouken Glen is flanked by big houses with extensive gardens\\n\\u201cI spent a lot of time at the playpark [with my children] during lockdown,\\u201d Thomas says. \\u201cThere was one roundabout fenced off for 18 months, then removed for another year and then finally put back. Three years to repair a single item. Rouken Glen is better maintained, cleaner and there\\u2019s no sense of danger.\\u201d As for leisure centres, of the two pools my children learned to swim in, Bellahouston is closed for a year for refurbishment, and Pollok is shut evenings and weekends. The pool at Eastwood Leisure Centre in East Renfrewshire is open every day.\\n\\nThe most intense resentment, though, is focused on education, where differences are at an extreme: Glasgow, resource-starved, but socially and culturally diverse, and East Renfrewshire, middle-class, well-equipped and highly aspirational. \\nAs a teacher who moved from Glasgow to East Renfrewshire when her twin daughters were one, then back to Glasgow when they reached the end of P1, Olivia Drennan is well-placed to compare the two. \\u201cI must be one of the very few people who moved out of East Renfrewshire when they had kids in primary school,\\u201d she laughs. \\n\\nShe and her husband bought their terraced house near Rouken Glen because they needed more space. At the toddlers\\u2019 groups, it was mostly grandparents and childminders, and she found the local nursery very focused on ensuring the children would perform well at their start-of-primary standardised assessments. \\nAt first, moving back to Glasgow was \\u201ca breath of fresh air\\u201d, but now her daughters are sitting their Highers, it\\u2019s more of an uphill struggle. \\u201cTheir secondary school is more diverse [than it would have been in East Renfrewshire], but they haven\\u2019t had the experience they would have had in terms of homework and expectations,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI know a lot of parents are getting tutors now, so, in a way, they are still buying their way out of the system.\\u201d  \\n\\nSuch disparities bring tensions. Pauline*, a charity worker who lives in Shawlands, told me her friend\\u2019s decision to move to East Renfrewshire almost caused a rift. \\u201cWe lived close by,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHad she not moved, our boys would have been in the same year. So it sort of felt like: \\u2018I see: something that is good enough for my son is not good enough for yours\\u2019.\\u201d\\n\\nThe 39-year-old likes that parents at her children\\u2019s primary school have a wide range of backgrounds and jobs, and she thinks Glaswegians owe it to local schools to stay put. \\u201cThey are being run really bare-boned,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThe kinds of things our parents\\u2019 association is fund-raising for are not luxuries, they are essentials. But there is something to be said for staying put and helping to raise it up.\\u201d\\n\\nThose of us who live on the East Renfrewshire side of the line are not oblivious to these criticisms. We know the attraction of living where we do comes from its proximity to the city, and we feel judged for not contributing.\\n\\nMarie Fleming, who works in HR and grew up in Govanhill, moved to Giffnock 20 years ago. \\u201cI consider myself Glaswegian and use Glasgow\\u2019s facilities all the time \\u2014 I love going to its galleries and theatres,\\u201d she said. \\n\\u201cIt was awful when the Tron Theatre lost its [council] funding last year. Living outside Glasgow, I can support these companies as commercial organisations by going to them, but it just feels so unfair that the burden falls on a small population in Glasgow when we know those of us outwith the boundaries who don\\u2019t pay for these facilities make excellent use of them. I\\u2019ve always felt bad about that.\\u201d\\n\\nGlasgow\\u2019s financial struggles are well-rehearsed. In the last decade, the city has been affected by a real-terms drop in Scottish Government funding. So have all local authorities. But Glasgow has been hit particularly hard on account of its poverty, its equal-pay debt, its legacy of Victorian buildings, and the fact it is a dispersal city for asylum seekers. (The Home Office\\u2019s move towards batch-processing of asylum decisions has put extra pressure on homelessness services, and there is no UK funding to support it.)  \\n\\nThe city is impacted by other anomalies. It has several galleries and a library of national standing which, like Edinburgh\\u2019s, are free to enter but unlike Edinburgh\\u2019s (and V&A Dundee), receive no Scottish Government money. It also owns the Clyde Tunnel, the only piece of national road infrastructure which is not centrally funded. \\n\\nCouncil tax only accounts for around 20% of local authorities\\u2019 income. But here again Glasgow is at a disadvantage because of its higher-than-average exemptions (around 25%) and its lower valuations. Of its 237,668 chargeable dwellings, more than half (130,750) are in band A or B, and only 7,076 (2.9%) are in band G and H. This means Glasgow has fewer G and H Band properties than East Renfrewshire, though East Renfrewshire only has 40,000 chargeable dwellings. Moreover, 29% of chargeable dwellings in Glasgow are eligible for council tax reduction compared with a Scottish average of 18%.\\n\\nFor the past few years, the population of the city has been growing again. The council expects to have collected \\u00a3350m in council tax by the end of the financial year \\u2014 \\u00a34.2m more than it anticipated at the start of the year \\u2014 as a result of there being more people in more homes. But its boundaries are tight. There are places where the line between Glasgow and its neighbouring local authority cuts across a street; so there are limits on how much it can expand. \\n\\nBecause of this, the city is looking for ways to increase its income from those who live outside the city. In May, the Scottish Government passed the Visitor Levy (Scotland) Bill, which gives local councils the power to introduce a tourist tax. In Glasgow, a working group has already been set up to look at the possibility of introducing this policy. But Glasgow is unlikely to derive the same benefits from a visitor levy as Edinburgh. \\n\\nInstead, city treasurer and deputy council leader Ricky Bell rhymes off some more promising income-generation possibilities: including a congestion charge, a toll on the Clyde Tunnel and an entry fee for museums, each imposed only on those living outside the city boundary.\\n\\nThe problem is the council would need to seek legislative consent for each of those proposals. What Bell would like is for the Scottish Government to delegate a more general power to local authorities so they can introduce measures that work for them. \\n\\u201cPeople say the city is not looking as good as it should, and there is an element of [truth in] that, but a lot of it comes down to the city being in a difficult financial situation,\\u201d Bell says. \\u201cWe are legally required to balance the budget, but we are not being given the levers to do it.\\u201d\\n\\nYet \\u2014 like most things \\u2014 the idea of making those who live outside the city boundaries pay for the services they use is more complicated than it seems. Just ask Ryan McGovern, a junior doctor based at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.  \\n\\nI catch up with him as he is making his daily commute home after a hard day\\u2019s work. He and his wife moved from a tenement flat in Shawlands to Lenzie in East Dunbartonshire four months ago with their baby because they could not afford a three-bedroomed house in the up and coming southside where property prices are rocketing.  \\n\\n\\u201cWe both work in the city and have family there, so we spend a lot of time crossing the boundary, and though we aren\\u2019t using public facilities like museums right now, we know that the big appeal of living in or around Glasgow is its cultural offering,\\u201d he says. \\nThen he breaks off to warn me he might lose signal because he is about to enter the Clyde Tunnel. \\u201cAh,\\u201d I say. \\u201cHow would you feel about the council introducing a tunnel toll for people like yourself?\\u201c\\n\\n\\u201cI understand that, as someone who isn\\u2019t paying council tax to Glasgow any more, I am not contributing to the upkeep of this piece of infrastructure,\\u201d he replies. \\u201cI guess my argument would be that I work for the NHS, so hopefully I am contributing to the greater good of the city in a different way. \\u201c\\n\\nRyan also points out that as a junior doctor he moves around every year. Last year, he was living in Glasgow and working at Crosshouse Hospital in East Ayrshire, and next year he will be living in East Dunbartonshire and working at Monklands Hospital in North Lanarkshire. \\u201cWhere I end up is beyond my control,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nThe resentments directed towards those of us who, like Ryan, live on the more affluent side of the city boundary are thorny and potentially dangerous because they divide communities, and lead to questions about who has the right to \\u201cbelong\\u201d.\\n\\nIn his 2023 work, \\u2018The Broken Promise of Infrastructure\\u2019, Dr Dominic Davies refers to these narratives as \\u201cinfrastructures of feeling\\u201d. Access to infrastructure \\u2014 clean tap water, smooth roads, to be able to leave a place with ease and come back, via bus or train \\u2014 represents our rights as citizens. \\nOur use of such services are \\u201cthe way a person exercises that citizenship\\u201d. In recent years, our infrastructure has begun to fail, exposing whose citizenship is \\u2014 seemingly \\u2014 prioritised.It is no wonder some bitterness festers against those in East Renfrewshire who have better public infrastructure \\u2014 or can circumvent its failure by using private means. \\n\\nBut the decisions that have led to Glasgow\\u2019s decline are not down to individuals who find themselves in a specific location or set of circumstances. They are and have always been political. \\u201cWe have inherited this odd system that was literally Thatcherite and doesn\\u2019t fit what we need,\\u201d Professor Docherty says. In the years since the boundaries were drawn, the gap has been entrenched by the shift of power eastwards, and by successive administrations in Westminster and Scotland which have turned a blind eye to Glasgow\\u2019s plight. In particular, one might look at the rejection by both governments of more progressive taxation, particularly, in Scotland, the failure to replace council tax, as the SNP promised. \\nHuman beings live in a constant state of flux. They move around as their job, finances and personal circumstances dictate. City boundaries will always be arbitrary; during lockdown, a ban on crossing from one local authority to another meant I wasn\\u2019t allowed to shop at my local supermarket, though I could travel 10 miles to Uplawmoor. \\n\\nMoreover, even in Glasgow, the use of other local authorities\\u2019 services is not one-way traffic. Those who live in the southside often bring their children to play in Rouken Glen, while those affected by the closure of Bellahouston now take their children to Paisley\\u2019s Lagoon.  \\n\\nPerhaps, instead of allowing ourselves to get caught up in a cycle of blame and guilt, we should ask ourselves whose purposes it suits for citizens of what is \\u2014 in truth \\u2014 just one big city to turn in on ourselves and each other? The resentment of the people who live in the city, and the self-flagellation of people who live in East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire, serves only to obscure the roots of Glasgow\\u2019s problems and divert attention from possible ways forward.\\n\\nA better solution might be something loosely modelled on what is happening down south. The Greater London Council (GLC) and England\\u2019s metropolitan county councils were abolished by Thatcher almost a decade before Strathclyde was broken up. \\nBut in 2000, the Greater London Authority \\u2014 composed of a directly-elected assembly and mayor \\u2014 was set up to close the gap in the capital\\u2019s political structures. Elsewhere, the country has seen various councils come together to form Combined Authorities. These authorities, each with their own mayors, have resources and powers devolved to them by Westminster so are able to take collective decisions across council boundaries. \\n\\nGlasgow is one of eight authorities that have formed a City Region cabinet, largely for the purpose of spending City Deal money. Although also involved in the Clyde Mission (the effort to transform a riverside corridor running from the city centre to the sea) and planning for the Clyde Metro, the City Region cabinet lacks the powers or the resources of England\\u2019s Combined Authorities, Nor does Glasgow have a mayor. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very weak way of trying to stitch back together some strategy at regional level,\\u201d Docherty says.\\nBell is not bothered about having a mayor \\u2014 \\u201cmayors centralise power and we need to look at decentralising it\\u201d \\u2014 but he does want to see more done at a strategic level. \\n\\n\\nAnd yet Docherty says that, while Greater Manchester Combined Authority has performed well as a result of \\u201cpreferential treatment\\u201d from central government, the others have struggled to make much of an impact. \\u201cCombined Authorities are the easy option,\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou just take the existing authorities and you layer something on top of it.\\u201d So what would he do? \\u201cI\\u2019d rip it up and start again.\\u201d\", \"author\": \"Saltire_Blue\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-10-13T16:44:42.433280\"}",

Anyway I've got a job offer and they've been doing training for the potential new hires for 3 days now. Tomorrow would be the 4th day.. However, all the potential new hires haven't actually signed their contracts yet. Anyways the training days are 6 hour days. They are giving the new hires only \\u00a350 for the 4 days of training (24 hours of training). Now if it was paid hourly that would be around \\u00a3300.. I find that very absurd and it makes me wonder if they dont get people to sign a contract until training is over so that they can get away with only giving them \\u00a350 and not the hourly wage. How is this even allowed? Back home that would never fly so I\\u2019m shocked. On top of that it\\u2019s a community care work position which requires you to use your vehicle and drive to different clients houses. The company does not pay mileage for this, instead they give you \\u00a370 a month for fuel and say that you can claim the mileages on your taxes? Now I believe this is true if you have business insurance but I don't have that. This doesn\\u2019t seem right as I\\u2019m pretty sure you would only get like 20% back? I would also have to wait a year to see that money right? or maybe i am wrong im not sure how it works... Anyways does this seem sketchy? I've never heard of a place doing four 6 hours days of training and only paying \\u00a350 and then on top of that expecting their employees to drive around town to clients houses to provide care and not pay them the correct mileage and just instead say \\u201cheres \\u00a370 a month for fuel\\u201d \\nThe training is also mandatory, the one girl was saying because she missed a day of training she can't start and has to wait until they do training again to make up for the day she missed.

Problem is, I live next to the vent and all the smoke from the burning charcoal goes past my flat window - I've frequently been getting burning eyes, sore throat, headache, etc when I'm in the flat since this started, never had a problem before that.\\n\\nThe graphs on this post are fine particulate matter (PM2.5) readings from the air quality monitor I have running in the flat - I have no gas appliances, I don't smoke, etc, so there are no sources of indoor pollution. All the flat windows are closed to try and minimise the effects of the smoke, but I'm still getting these high readings.\\n\\nThe calendar in the last image charts when elevated levels occur - I was optimistic about the green/low pollution level days last week, but we're back to red/high pollution levels again this week. On orange days there's a burning/smoke odour, on red days it's a strong burning odour, almost like burning plastic on some days when there's especially high readings.\\n\\nThese increases occur within the restaurant's opening hours and are far above background PM2.5 levels according to other measurement points in Glasgow.\\n\\nI've contacted several folk over the past months:\\n\\n- contacted the restaurant, nice people but I don't really know enough about restaurant ventilation systems to suggest possible fixes here\\n\\n- contacted environmental health, very slow to respond to emails, changeover in staff seems to have slowed progress\\n\\n- contacted the MSP, who's been genuinely very good with fast responses and chasing the council\\n\\n- contacted the housing association, who have also been very good in following up on issues and taking this seriously\\n\\nMostly just wanted to highlight that there is surprisingly little recourse for ongoing smoke pollution, even when it's reaching very high levels like this. The MSP and housing association taking this seriously is welcome and appreciated, but ultimately this situation is continuing - high levels of particulate matter is a well-known health risk, and means I can't stay in my flat in peace.\\n\\nAny suggestions if there's anything more I can do with trying to get this resolved?\", \"author\": \"Excellent_Paint5192\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-10-28T16:49:42.851770\"}",

I've already joined the Reach Programme Teams page, but I know the top-up would be more beneficial for me as I want to do history (and Spanish, but that's secondary). I've already started doing the first 2 assignments for the Law Reach Programme, but I literally just found out 1. What the top up programme includes and how it differs from the Reach Programme,  and 2. That I've been accepted to both.\\n\\nI know there's literally no way to do them both, and I will be talking to my teachers tomorrow for advice on how to proceed, but if anyone has any advice/help they could give, that would be amazing!\\n\\nI do have a few questions for people who have done either Programme:\\n\\n1. What type of work does the Top-up Programme include?\\n2. Is the Top-up Programme difficult?\\n3. Is the Reach law Programme difficult?\\n4. Has anyone been in this situation before (lol)?\\n5. Does the Top-up Programme lower the qualifications I need for Uni courses/degrees, and does it help (especially since I cannot do math, and can barley pass Nat5 Apps)\\n6.

I want to comment on this matter because I watched a video by Comrade StoryTellerHK \\u8aaa\\u66f8\\u5ba2 (Also a Hong Kong Marxist) about Guy Debord\\u2019s work \\\"The Society of the Spectacle\\\" \\u2013 a critique to Capitalist Society, and I have also been studying modern Scottish history. I have been following Scottish news, so I am aware of the John Maclean statue campaign. While I respect Comrade John Maclean, I question the rationale of commemorating him by crowdfunding a statue \\u2013 would this kind of memorial risks turning his ideals into a consumable image?\\n\\nIn the following, I will also cite Comrade StorytellerHK\\u2019s descriptions and examples in his video (his examples are really excellent!) to illustrate my concerns about the statue for MacLean and the issues I see with it.\\n\\nI have also linked his original full length video, just in case you wanted to watch it. You can click the \\\"Show transcript\\\" which will show you all his script, which is written in standard Chinese, which means you can translate it or you can use the translation function for the subtitles to translate it. \\n\\n(\\\"Commodities\\\" might be translated into \\\"Products\\\" and \\\"Spectacle\\\" might be translated into \\\"Landscape\\\". So be aware of that.)\\n\\nSince all my doubts for erecting a statue for Maclean stem from the critique of capitalism in \\\"The Society of the Spectacle\\\" by Guy Debord, I will begin by stating what \\\"consumerism\\\", \\\"spectacle\\\", and \\\"image value\\\" are.\\n\\n>To understand what \\\"Spectacle\\\" is, we must first understand how our society is \\u201cseparated\\u201d. I will use the separation of relationships between people as an example to illustrate the separation of society. \\n\\n>Originally, the relationship between us is directly between me and you, but capitalism separates this relationship, and a commodity appears in the middle to become a barrier between people. This may sound abstract, but we see it in many everyday examples. \\n\\n>For example, when a couple gets married, they need a betrothal gift, a banquet, and a diamond ring. Well, it is clearly a relationship between a couple\\u2014a relationship between you and me. Then, why do I need a betrothal gift, a banquet, and a diamond ring to prove my \\\"love\\\" for you? Why do I need these \\\"commodities\\\" to demonstrate the value of this relationship?\\n\\n>For example, if it's your friend's birthday, you might buy them a birthday gift or treat them to a meal. But why do you need to prove your friendship with \\\"commodities\\\"?\\n\\n>Or maybe you take an Uber and the driver is very nice and polite. He helps you with your luggage and opens and closes the car door for you and you think he is a very good driver with a very good service attitude, so after getting off the car you decide to tip the driver. Your gratitude to the driver is expressed through the commodity \\\"tips\\\".\\n\\n>Under capitalism, these interpersonal relationships and emotions are all presented in the form of commodities. This is when commodities separate the relationships between people. Similarly, between the producer and the products they create, and between people and reality, the relationship is mediated and separated by commodities. Moreover, this separation is neither accidental nor exceptional, it exists systematically and universally in our society. Therefore, under capitalism, society is a state of \\u201cSeparation Perfected\\u201d. Our relationship with everything in the world has been separated by \\\"commodities\\\", and people's real life experiences have been replaced by experiences expressed in the form of \\\"commodities\\\", just like love is expressed in the form of a \\\"diamond ring\\\". Generally speaking, we call this kind of society separated by commodities \\\"commodity fetishism\\\", which means that commodities hide the proper social relationships and make commodities seem to have autonomous power to control people's destiny.\\n\\n>The Society of the Spectacle' argues that under the development of capitalism, commodity fetishism has evolved, and society is no longer simply a relationship between people and commodities. Now, there is a layer of \\\"spectacle\\\" on top of commodities, but what is it? First, with the development of capitalism, the value of \\\"commodities\\\" began to shift. Generally speaking, the value of a commodity lies in its use value: just as the value of a meal lies in the fact that it can satisfy our hunger after we eat it; or, the value of housing lies in the fact that it's where we live.\\n\\n>But, under the development of capitalism, the value of a commodity gradually becomes its exchange value, that\\u2019s, how much it can be sold for. It's like the value of housing's how much it can be sold for. \\n\\n>But that's not all. Later, the value of commodities gradually shifted to its \\\"image value\\\", which is that the commodities present an image through packaging, advertising, and so on, and what we end up buying is that \\u201cimage\\u201d itself. But that's not all. Later, the value of commodities gradually shifted to its \\u201cimage value\\u201d, which is that the commodities present an image through packaging, advertising, and so on, and what we end up buying is that \\u201cimage\\u201d itself. It's like before the ban on cigarette advertising, Marlboro once had a classic advertisement portraying the image of the cowboy. When you buy Marlboro, what you're buying is the \\u201cimage value\\u201d of Marlboro. And this commodity image is a form of the \\u201cspectacle.\\u201d The so-called \\u201cspectacle\\u201d refers to social relationships mediated by images, the focus is on seeing and being seen. A commodity expresses its image value through the spectacle, this is what we call \\u201cThe Commodity as Spectacle.\\u2019 As our social relationships become increasingly separated by commodities, those commodities, in turn, use the spectacle as a medium to display their images. So in our daily lives, the spectacle is actually everywhere, it constantly surrounds us. It's not only the tangible, purchasable commodities like Marlboro advertisements that are spectacles; rather, our entire social life appears as a vast accumulation of spectacles.\\n\\nAt this part, have you noticed at this moment by crowdfunding money to erect this statue for Maclean: you are essentially buying the image value: the physical statue itself - its material form, its presence in a public space; the symbolic image of Maclean as a revolutionary hero; The mediated social image of yourself as someone who honors radical history; The aestheticized, consumable image for the public, tourists, or media. \\n\\nThis spectacle then drives others to use the same method of crowdfunding statues to celebrate anti-capitalism, in order to prove that they are active in resisting capitalism, leading even more people to consume things that have no practical use for the revolution. But the reason we want to honor MacLean is clearly to acknowledge & support his dedication, actions, & efforts toward the proletarian revolution \\u2014 his lived experiences themselves. So why has the creation of these spectacles also become part of how we recognize & support him? Why don\\u2019t we instead do more practical things to resist the oppression of the proletariat under capitalism? to fight for greater rights for them? Why spend our time consuming something like a \\u201cstatue,\\u201d which holds no tactical value in the struggle against capitalism? Can spending money to build a statue really give workers more rights? Obviously not. It only fuels consumerism, reinforces the \\u201cspectacle,\\u201d and deepens capitalism\\u2019s control over us. If we want to honor MacLean himself, we should invest in the revolution itself, to put his revolutionary experiences into practice, ensuring that these struggles continue from one generation to the next. Moreover, Maclean\\u2019s contributions to resisting capitalism are something our brains can directly access. So why do we still need to use this spectacle to prove that the memory exists? This example clearly illustrates the \\u201cSeparation Perfected\\\" mentioned earlier: even the memories we can directly access in our minds are separated by the spectacle, and we feel the need for it to prove that the memory exists.\\n\\nThis is why I see even \\\"well-intentioned\\\" acts like honoring Maclean with a statue as paradoxical: it creates multiple commodified images of anti-capitalist ideals within the very capitalist system he opposed, thereby strengthening capitalism\\u2019s control and also separates us from him on a personal, human level.\\n\\nSome might argue that these problems would disappear once capitalism vanishes. I would say that even if what separates us is not a commodity, but an object, that object can still separate the relationships between us people to people. Even in a socialist society, if people are not critical to the objects and symbols, they could still use diamond rings to prove their love. Why must I express my respect for Comrade Maclean through a statue? Why should my relationship or comradeship with him be separated by a statue? The disappearance of capitalism does not mean we can disregard our critical approach to objects and symbols, as long as we are not critical, separation of our relationships by objects will still continue.\", \"author\": \"Unknownunknow1840\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-10-31T09:18:33.866027\"}",

They accumulate titles, vanity awards, and magazine covers like trading cards, but when you check the Companies House filings, the empires collapse into dust. Enter Luthais McCash \\u2014 or as he prefers to style himself online, \\u201cDr Lord Luthais Brand McCash\\u201d \\u2014 a 31-year-old from Scotland who has built a digital persona far more substantial than his corporate record. I've recently found another post on this reddit channel about [Luthais McCash](https://www.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/1jrnm05/has_anyone_dealt_with_luthais_mccash_claims_of/) that also records his history\\n\\nIn 2025, McCash began promoting his latest project, [Ascentris Limited](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/16327075), with the zeal of a man unveiling a Silicon Valley unicorn. The trouble is, Ascentris was only incorporated on 19 March 2025 and, like most of his past creations, appears to be little more than a shell.\\n\\n# \\ud83e\\uddfe The Basics\\n\\n**Full legal name:** Luthais Brand McCash (Luthais McCash)  \\n**Aliases:** Dr Lord Luthais Brand McCash  \\n**Date of birth:** July 1994  \\n**Nationality:** British (Scottish)  \\n**Current venture:** Ascentris Limited (Company No. 16327075)  \\n**Date of incorporation:** 19 March 2025  \\n**Registered office:** A virtual address in London  \\n**Website:** [ascentris.co.uk](https://ascentris.co.uk)\\n\\nMcCash lists himself as both director and sole shareholder. The website positions Ascentris as a global investment vehicle and \\u201ctechnology incubator.\\u201d The imagery leans heavily on the aesthetic of venture capital \\u2014 all grayscale portraits, serif fonts, and pseudo-academic jargon \\u2014 but the filings tell a more provincial story.\\n\\nThat \\u201cLord\\u201d title, for instance, appears to have been acquired through one of those online novelty schemes where you \\u201cbuy a plot of land\\u201d and receive a certificate proclaiming nobility. There is no record of any peerage, academic doctorate, or legitimate title granted under UK law.\\n\\n# \\ud83d\\udcbc The Vanishing \\u201cExits\\u201d\\n\\nMcCash\\u2019s self-promotion hinges on claims of having achieved multiple \\u201cexits.\\u201d The Companies House records, however, show a conveyor belt of entities that never survived long enough to trade, let alone sell.\\n\\n# 1. Ologramma Ltd (14590473)\\n\\n* **Incorporated:** 7 June 2024\\n* **Dissolved:** 18 June 2024 \\u2014 compulsory strike-off after ten days.\\n* **Director/shareholder:** McCash.\\n* **Accounts filed:** None.\\n* **Trade activity:** None. In other words, it never existed in any meaningful sense. Yet McCash has referred to Ologramma as an \\u201cAI creative venture successfully exited.\\u201d\\n\\n# 2. Master FX Ltd (15032140)\\n\\n* **Incorporated:** 19 July 2023\\n* **Dissolved:** 10 December 2024 (compulsory strike-off).\\n* **Last shareholder:** McCash (100%). No sale, no accounts, no \\u201cexit.\\u201d Just another digital ghost.\\n\\n# 3. Fytec Ltd (SC521335)\\n\\n* **Incorporated:** 16 November 2015\\n* **Dissolved:** 9 May 2017. This one predates Ascentris by nearly a decade but has recently been rebranded in his narrative as a \\u201ccore foundation\\u201d of the Ascentris ecosystem. A stretch worthy of Olympic gymnastics.\\n\\n# \\ud83e\\udde9 The Phantom Portfolio\\n\\nThe Ascentris website presents a \\u201cportfolio\\u201d of investments that reads like a list of imaginary start-ups. Names such as *Meixter*, *Exosuit*, and *Relife Wellness* appear under banners like \\u201cCurrent Holdings\\u201d and \\u201cActive Ventures.\\u201d None of these have registered business entities, VAT numbers, or tangible operations.\\n\\nA few that do appear on record raise further questions:\\n\\n* **Sigma Solutions Global Ltd (SC652481)** \\u2013 reported losses exceeding \\u00a3500,000, and creditors owed over \\u00a3840,000. Filings are unaudited. The website has since been suspended. McCash is listed as both director and PSC.\\n* **CultureStore Ltd / Parka London** \\u2013 McCash is currently in litigation with former owner Stephen Lever (Circuit Commercial Court reference [CC-2025-MAN-000047](https://caseboard.io/cases/265e412f-985f-4668-b1e9-76a5b03bf3d0)) regarding alleged misrepresentation in acquisition.\\n* **Relife Wellness Ltd (15202691)** \\u2013 non-trading, with ownership switching between McCash and Ascentris. No revenue, no staff, no accounts.\\n\\nThe rest \\u2014 *Meixter*, *Exosuit*, *Dr Luthais Holdings* \\u2014 do not appear anywhere in Companies House or public trading records.\\n\\n# \\ud83c\\udfda\\ufe0f A Decade of Vanishing Acts\\n\\nIn ten years, McCash has attached his name to at least eighteen companies, twelve of which were dissolved via compulsory strike-off.

Several new Ascentris-linked companies now appear to use nominee directors \\u2014 a classic tactic for avoiding personal traceability.\\n\\n# \\ud83e\\udde0 The Psychology of the Persona\\n\\nInterviews with individuals who\\u2019ve worked with or invested alongside McCash suggest a familiar pattern.  \\n  \\nHe presents himself as a titled investor with vast assets, luxury cars, and an international property portfolio. To build rapport, he mixes grandiosity with pity \\u2014 claims of illness, near death, trauma, or impending disability \\u2014 which elicit sympathy and lower defences.\\n\\nOnce credibility cracks and individuals carry out research, the tone flips: threats, intimidation, and online smear tactics. McCash has circulated fabricated articles to discredit former colleagues, some published on low-rent \\u201cpress release\\u201d networks or pay-to-play media outlets. When the local credibility evaporates, he relocates and starts the performance again.\\n\\n# \\ud83c\\udfad Paid Press & Purchased Prestige\\n\\nHis \\u201cmedia appearances\\u201d are largely sponsored features from pay-for-placement outlets including:\\n\\n* *The CIO Times*\\n* *Leaders Vision Magazine*\\n* *The CEO Publication*\\n\\nEach offers paid editorial packages for \\u201caward winners\\u201d or \\u201cthought leaders.\\u201d McCash\\u2019s trophies \\u2014 \\u201cInnovator of the Year,\\u201d \\u201cTop 100 Visionary CEO\\u201d \\u2014 are, by all accounts, available to anyone with a debit card.\\n\\n# \\u2696\\ufe0f Legal & Tribunal Records\\n\\nMcCash has been cited in multiple Employment Tribunal judgments for unpaid wages and poor conduct:\\n\\n* [Mr R Schuhmann v Sigma Solutions Global Ltd & McCash Consulting Ltd (4101164/2022)](https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunal-decisions/mr-r-schuhmann-v-sigma-solutions-global-ltd-and-mccash-consulting-ltd-4101164-slash-2022)\\n* [C Iley v McCash Consulting Ltd (2500107/22)](https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunal-decisions/c-iley-v-mccash-consulting-ltd-2500107-slash-2022)\\n\\nBoth found against him.

Every quote traces back to McCash himself.\\n\\n# \\ud83d\\udea9 TL;DR: The Pattern of Performance\\n\\n\\u201cDr Lord\\u201d Luthais McCash presents himself as a serial entrepreneur and investor through Ascentris Ltd.

    "1oo8r29": "{\"text\": \"Northside cafe drama: Zaman Shawarma (smoke, carbon monoxide alarm) An update to the smoke from restaurant thread from last week. Thank you everyone for all the great advice there, I'm genuinely very grateful.\\n\\ntl;dr: restaurant set off carbon monoxide alarms due to burning charcoal, very unimpressed with their response\\n\\nThe restaurant in question is Zaman Shawarma in Maryhill.\\n\\nSee that huge spike in particulate matter (PM2.5) on the night of 16th October? That led to the carbon monoxide alarm going off at my neighbour's at 6am that morning, which is consistent with charcoal being left to smoulder overnight. (The screenshot of the CO alarm panel was from a few days ago - the alarm occurred on the morning of 17th October.)\\n\\nThe carbon monoxide levels were between 45 and 90ppm - [people have been evacuated in other incidents elsewhere for levels in this range] (https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/they-could-killed-us-surrey-29190069). Bear in mind that these readings were recorded by a sensor on the third floor - carbon monoxide rises and the restaurant is on the ground floor, so the carbon monoxide levels on first and second floors are likely to have been even higher than this. From what my neighbour was saying, there was no smell of gas on the night of this alarm, which to me indicates that the carbon monoxide exposure unlikely to have come from a gas line, and would match with being generated by charcoal. The gas engineer who responded to the alarm call couldn't find any sources within my neighbour's flat.\\n\\nI don't know if my alarm went off because I wasn't in the flat at the time. I've had to move in with a relative temporarily because I was ill almost every afternoon, evening, and late at night in my flat - headache, burning eyes, sore throat, chest pain, itchy skin, difficulty concentrating, and nausea. Some of these symptoms are caused by particulate matter (eg. red eyes) but I've since learnt that some of them (eg. nausea) can be caused by chronic exposure to lower levels of carbon monoxide - not enough to set off my alarm, but elevated beyond normal background levels. The symptoms lifted after a few hours of being away from the flat and returned when I came back if the restaurant charcoal grill was running. I haven't had any of these symptoms while staying at my relative's place. The CO alarm I have at mine only starts showing readings above 30ppm, but I've since learnt that chronic exposure to levels below this (eg. 20ppm) can cause symptoms as well.\\n\\nI got in contact with the restaurant owners again and they either don't understand or don't care about the impact they've had on their charcoal smoke making us unwell for months and putting our lives at risk with that carbon monoxide alarm. They offered a compromise in late July of only using charcoal two days a week instead of every day. I agreed to this initially because I was tired of being ill all the time and just wanted even a temporary break from symptoms, but it didn't really resolve the any of the issues. After being given space to recover in a flat away from the smoke and thinking more clearly, an offer of only being exposed to hazardous smoke two days a week instead of seven is really not acceptable.\\n\\nI wonder about the claim of using charcoal twice a week. The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) readings would usually spike into the high/red threshold two or three days a week, but we would still get readings bad enough to affect health (orange) on over 80% of the days I was recording measurements (I installed the air quality monitor on 28th August). Were they maybe using less charcoal on the other days or something? I'm not sure, but if this claim is true then we would've been subject to the high/red levels of PM2.5 all week which is even worse. Even worse still, current regulations and the lack of consistency in responsiveness or action from environmental health at the council would've allowed this.\\n\\nIn any case, the restaurant owners are annoyed that I complained to the council about these smoke issues and openly acknowledge that charcoal smoke is harmful to the health of residents ('I haven't used anything harmful since last week' is a very interesting sentence). They switched to using an electric grill on Saturday, but this only happened after a visit from the council or possibly the local MSP on Friday - they continued to use charcoal for months even after they were made aware it was causing illness, and for two weeks after the carbon monoxide alarm alerted, and after they've already been fined for charcoal smoke emissions back when the vent was on first floor. The restaurant owners either didn't know or didn't care that charcoal smoke is harmful to health and generates carbon monoxide, which indicates a severe problem with allowing people who are either incompetent or negligent to burn solid fuels in restaurants below residential blocks. All the reviews for Zaman Shawarma say the owners are lovely people, but their lack of concern for our health and continued generation of harmful substances really leaves a sour taste.\\n\\nThe reason I'm posting this even though they've switched to the electric grill is to call attention to current regulations not protecting the health of residents. Even though the restaurant had been fined for charcoal smoke previously, there were no checks of their ventilation system and use of charcoal to make sure we were safe in the flats above. Even though the carbon monoxide alarm went off, environmental health have not responded to three emails asking to meet their team (which they initiated way back in mid-October) and raising alarms about high readings/CO alarms - the previous visit in early August was just someone saying 'I don't think it smells that bad' and refusing to look at video recordings of the smoke, diary entries, or complaints from multiple different households. More broadly, there doesn't appear to be a test for competence for knowing how to safely use and filter substances like burning charcoal which harm health and generate toxic carbon monoxide when burnt.\\n\\nThe current system of regulations and disinterest from the council environmental health department effectively allows business owners to sacrifice the health of residents for profit. It's especially troubling that the carbon monoxide alarm didn't seem to change anything - does someone have to die for action to be taken?\\n\\nThanks for reading, I know this was a lot. Very unhappy with Zaman Shawarma choosing to put money over our health and potentially our lives for months on end. Shoutout to Bob Doris MSP and his office staff for taking this seriously and investigating this. \\n\\nLastly: buy a CO alarm, it could save your life (ideally get one that measures levels below 30ppm as well). I know there's several other residential blocks affected by charcoal smoke elsewhere in the city - if that's you, DM me for advice any time.\", \"author\": \"Excellent_Paint5192\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-11-04T14:44:24.128674\"}",

We do not have exact figures yet, but based on previous allocations we anticipate that the revenue funding for the Glasgow City Region will be a maximum of about \\u00a37m a year, down from \\u00a333m at its peak under UKSPF. That is a very significant shift.\\n\\u201cFor context, the revenue allocation for Glasgow City Council this year is \\u00a39m. Under the new model we would expect that to drop to around \\u00a32\\u20133m, and that funding currently supports our skills and employability programmes, business support, third-sector grants, innovation work and so on.\\u201d\\nHe said the shift from revenue to capital funding would also create a \\u00a3300,000 budget pressure in council staffing costs.\\nA motion expressing \\u201cdeep concern\\u201d and calling on the council\\u2019s Chief Executive to write to the UK Government and the city\\u2019s MPs was passed.\\nA Labour amendment asking the Chief to \\u201cseek clarification\\u201d on the funding was unsuccessful.\\nThe Pride in Place programme was announced in September, shortly after Sir Keir Starmer's major cabinet reshuffle.\\nThe Prime Minister described the \\u00a3292m package as a central plank of Labour\\u2019s \\u201cPlan for Change\\u201d and the \\u201clargest transfer of power from Whitehall to communities in history\\u201d.\\nAt the time, Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said the programme was \\u201cdirect funding from the Scotland Office to local communities the length and breadth of Scotland\\u201d.\\nHe added: \\u201cIt is delivering on a manifesto commitment that the Scotland Office will be a spending department, targeting UK Government money directly at some of the biggest challenges we face here in Scotland.\\n\\u201cThis money will ensure that local people are in the lead in meeting local problems and it reflects our commitment that after a decade of austerity, a decade of renewal is now underway.\\n\\u201cFor too long, people have watched their towns and streets decline \\u2014 powerless to stop boarded-up shops and neglected parks. That ends now.\\u201d\\nSusan Aitken, the SNP leader of Glasgow City Council, said: \\u201cIt was clear from the moment it was announced that the Pride in Place fund was not generous to Glasgow or its city region \\u2013 less than \\u00a330m a year to Scotland out of a total \\u00a35bn just does not add up.\\n\\u201cHowever, the last-minute admission that even this is not new funding is genuinely shocking.\\n\\u201cWhat was sold to people across Glasgow as a \\u00a340m investment now looks to be a cut of at least \\u00a36m in the next year alone.\\n\\u201cThat is money that supports real jobs \\u2013 and a range of projects on employability, skills and business support, including a number in the city\\u2019s third sector.\\n\\u201cWhat is becoming very apparent is that the Pride in Place fund is not only robbing Peter to pay Paul, but fleecing Paul for good measure.\\u201d\\nCouncillor Molyneux tweeted: \\u201cUK Government Pride in Place latest: No new money, a \\u00a32m cut to Glasgow next year, jobs at risk.\\u201d\\nThe UK Government has been approached for comment.\\u201d\\n\", \"author\": \"Ok-Glove-847\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-11-08T09:15:41.451763\"}",

    "1p0jb1d": "{\"text\": \"My day trip to your great city You may recall me asking if Rouken Glen Park, Pollok Park, and Silverburn were doable in a day. Well yesterday I came up. Here's what I did.\\n\\nAfter getting off the train at Central I got the bus to Rouken Glen Park (thanks to the person who suggested getting off at Treemain Road). I took a walk through the park with the sun shining bright and frost on the ground. I'd only slept 3 hours the night before and was nodding off on the train up, but the cold soon woke me up and had me feeling fresh.\\n\\nRouken Glen was lovely, especially the waterfall. Before that I looked out for where they filmed a scene of Rab C Nesbitt, and got myself a black pudding, square sausage and tatty scone roll at the Boathouse cafe. This was delicious and nobody does breakfasts like you do in Scotland. \\n\\nI walked along the muddy paths of the little glen, safe in the knowledge my walking boots were taking the impact and keeping my jeans clean, before heading for the walled garden. Being November there wasn't anything in there so I headed for the garden centre bus stop.\\n\\nAfter 2 buses (changing in Shawlands) I ended up at Pollok Park. Wow! You are so lucky having that on your doorstep! I stuck my head in the Burrell Collection and had a quick look around to remind myself I need to be more cultured, but then went in search of these Highland coos. They didn't disappoint. Standing there, I looked around and I felt as if I was in the middle of nowhere rather than a few miles from Glasgow city cebtre. \\n\\nNext was Pollok House which one of you told me was closed, but I wanted a photo. I was a bit disappointed to see it covered in scaffolding, but it's great to see they're making it look even better. After seeing the bridge and walking the gardens (again, not much in them this time of year), I had a relaxing walk back around to the North gate, after deciding to abandon going to Silverburn.\\n\\nI took a bus to Govan which I was expecting to be really run down for some reason, but it actually wasn't. At Baynes I had the best Scotch Pie I've ever had - stupidly eating it next to a statue that seemed popular with pigeons.\\n\\nI hadn't realised how close the Riverside Museum was, so rather than taking the Subway to Kelvinbridge which I'd intended to, I walked across the bridge to the museum for a toilet stop. I've been to the museum twice before so didn't have a look around. Instead I walked to and through Kelvingrove Park. That was buzzing with people and is lovely.\\n\\nI ended up at Park Circus. What stunning houses and I just love that sandstone. After walking down to Woodlands Road and still having 3 hours before I needed to even think about getting to the station, I remembered the First Glasgow bus ticket burning a hole in my pocket.\\n\\nI took a #4 bus through the beautiful university area which was brimming with life and ended up in Hyndland. I crossed the road and took the same route in the opposite direction and ended up in some area of Clarkston. Why you may ask? Well, I've seen the city centre countless times and I didn't fancy anymore walking, and I like to see the real parts of a city (where people live). All I did in Clarkston was get the same route back, but to Bridge Street Subway so I could have a ride on your tiny little underground. I love it, especially them dinky little island platforms. It's surreal watching one of the trains entering the station with them lights. \\n\\nI walked down Buchanan Street which has to be my second favourite city street in the UK (Regent Street in London takes my top spot). The Christmas lights weren't on except for those on buildings, which were stunning. The canopy of lights in the Merchant City looked great too.\\n\\nBefore I headed for my train(s) back to Liverpool, I had a very quick walk around the small Christmas market at St Enoch. \\n\\nAll in all a great day.

Imagining waking up to that? Hard pass.\\n\\nThe Most Famous Sightings, One of the most well-known encounters happened in Crosshill, where a woman woke up to find the Gurning Man standing in her bedroom, grinning and making bizarre expressions. No forced entry, nothing missing, nothing damaged \\u2014 he just fled when she screamed.\\n\\nAround the same time, joggers and night-shift workers reported seeing a strange, contorted-faced man running through the Southside, sometimes shirtless, sometimes barefoot, always giving off major \\u201cnot right at all\\u201d energy.\\n\\nWas He Real or Just Urban Legend? That\\u2019s the million-pound question.\\n\\nThere are a few theories:\\n\\nA local man with a condition (neurological or psychological) that caused facial spasms\\n\\nA prowler who became mythologised over time\\n\\nMass hysteria \\u2014 stories feeding on one another\\n\\nOr, for the spooky crowd\\u2026 something a bit more supernatural\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Gurning Man stories dried up around 1979, which only adds to the mystery.

I actually do feel safe, my argument being I have never had trouble from these people. Yes I go on to say about atmosphere changing etc but im trying to highlight what I am hearing from others.\\n\\nA recent post got me thinking. In Scotland we still casually use labels like \\u201cNEDs\\u201d, \\u201cBAMs\\u201d, \\u201cjunkies\\u201d, etc. But is that really fair now? We\\u2019d never get away with using other stereotypes without getting absolutely destroyed for it yet for some reason it\\u2019s still socially acceptable to mock certain groups like this.\\n\\n I did grow up around poorer families and around these so-called \\u201cnon-educated delinquents\\u201d that people love to label. And honestly, I\\u2019ve never had any trouble from them in the last 20 years. When I was younger, yes, there was the odd bit of hassle, but as an adult? Nothing.\\n\\nDespite that, Glasgow City Centre just doesn\\u2019t feel as safe anymore. Even recently, going Christmas shopping around 5pm on a Saturday, the whole atmosphere felt off. I was approached twice by WHITE men on separate occasions and neither of them were \\u201cNEDs\\u201d, \\u201cjunkies\\u201d, \\u201cBAMs\\u201d, or homeless.\\n\\nSo I\\u2019m genuinely curious, Why does Glasgow City Centre feel unsafe these days? Maybe I\\u2019ve just grown up extremely oblivious or lucky in the sense that I\\u2019ve never personally had trouble from these groups, I know other people absolutely have. But that\\u2019s exactly why I\\u2019m asking. What's changed? \\n\\nJust to add i have seen a lot on social media platforms about how people dont feel safe walking home alone anymore, a newspaper article saying they dont let staff work at night in Glasgow City Centre. \\n\\nhttps://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/15603849/glasgow-square-dangerous-boss-warns-staff-not-work-late/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\", \"author\": \"Waste_Witness4789\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-11-24T01:25:04.182702\"}",

Says it all. \\n\\nSick pay is promised after 2/3 years service and then refused when you need it. \\u201cCase by case\\u201d basis. So on top of the low pay this isn\\u2019t a benefit.\\n\\n\\nTotally unrealistic goals set so they have a reason to discipline you and it was to a point where staff would steal your cases to close so they could hit targets. I reported this to a team manager who was also sleeping with a married member of staff and she asked me \\u201cwho the fuck I was talking to\\u201d on a call floor with 150 people. \\n\\n\\nThey had a bulldog upper manager who would phone team managers at 12 am asking why an individuals targets (after call,the amount of calls taken) are off and what they\\u2019re gona do about it in the morning..she had a heart attack and died young..surprise.\\n\\nCourt cases documented with a quick google will outline their discriminatory policies. For instance one of them states they laid off several staff because the client wanted the 5 lowest performers (sales) gone. No investigation.\\n\\nEvery conversation is a record of conversation as they love to have something on you to threaten you to hit more metrics (this was the norm) I\\u2019m talking, you took too long in after call to write you notes, can you sign this and confirm you understand? 3 of those and your on a performance plan. \\n\\nI went through the process of changing my contract to work from home..I later found out this was all nonsense and no change took place. I give it to them they were smart enough to have this conversation over the phone and not in writing - another thing to watch out for and this was my mistake.\\n\\nDuring the Covid work from home times you\\u2019d be told your coming back into the office full time if metrics weren\\u2019t hit..for the full dep. I was told to have my resignation on the managers desk if I wasn\\u2019t happy. I obliged \\u270c\\ufe0flater I was called and told I misunderstood that very direct message. Luckily I screenshot everything.\\n\\nI remember being called into a room and berated for the moral on the floor being low, when my colleague questioned this they were relegated to another team. Nothing to do with the low wages and awful environment.\\n\\nExtremely cliquey and upper management sleeping with staff (his wife is also employed there)..Each to their own but there\\u2019s an abuse of power dynamic here which made me uncomfortable and it speaks to the character of these idiots.\\n\\nThey introduced drug testing as there was class A\\u2019s found in the toilet..fair enough but literally your entire upper management are hoovering gear all weekend. Try them on a Monday morning.\\n\\nThey expect you to sign in 15 mins early so you are ready for your shift..I recently discovered this is nonsense and illegal..you should be paid for this fyi.\\n\\nExtremely abusive and the way they treat and speak to staff is always accusatory and sometimes outright aggressive.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re considering it and need money I get it but honestly i wouldn\\u2019t. \\n\\nTruly a miserable existence and for those cliquey manager who are so unskilled and unable to find employment elsewhere..I hope you rot there in your sad little existence. \\n\\n\\nPlease share your stories \\u270a\", \"author\": \"Either_Macaron_8131\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-12-03T14:18:51.961404\"}",

Hi all,  \\nAs a big fan of [Jet Lag: The Game](https://www.youtube.com/@jetlagthegame), which is a game show webseries featuring various board-game-inspired games played across countries, I've wanted to play the Hide & Seek home game since it got released, but *unfortunately* all my friends say it sounds *boring* and that they *\\\"don't want to sit somewhere random in Glasgow for hours\\\"* or some bullshit like that.  \\nHowever, I figure there's some nerds like me on here that are either Jet Lag fans or think playing hide and seek across an entire city sounds like good fun, so:  \\n\\n# Come play hide and seek with me\\n(Or if you're already playing JTLG hide and seek and would accept another player let me know :)  \\n**Wait what actually is this?**: Jet Lag: The Game's Hide and Seek game, which is more or less the same game played in their Hide and Seek series on the channel. [The NYC miniseries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zftv6Kh2zi4) is a pretty good example.   \\nOne player gets a set amount of time, probably an hour for Glasgow, to get Somewhere in Glasgow by public transport and hide. Everyone else, travelling as a team, get to ask various questions like \\\"are you east or west of me\\\" or \\\"take a picture of the tallest structure you can see\\\" to find the hider, but at a cost of earning the hider cards such as time bonuses or curses they can use to turn the game in their favour.       \\n\\n**When?** Probably on weekends, when people have time. One \\\"run\\\" should last maybe two to three hours, and if you've got three players, usually you do six runs across a couple days.  \\n \\n**Where?** Glasgow! We'll probably start off somewhere like Buchanan Street so Central and Queen St are sort of equidistant. The play area will either be the council boundary or SPT zones 1+2.  \\n  \\n**How?** We'll organise via a Discord or WhatsApp group. Once we've got a group organised, I'll buy the game and then we can play!  \\n  \\n**Wait, buy?** Yeah it costs money. But you get playing cards and everything! The game and its expansion cost \\u00a335, which we could split. Also by nature of public transport you'll have to pay for that. I recommend we get SPT zonecards since we'll probably be hopping between subway, busses, and trains a lot.\\n\\nIf anyone's interested, please leave a comment below or message me! Or as above, if anyone's already running a Glasgow hide and seek and are looking for more members, please post that below too! Looking forward to playing with you all :)\\n\\n*(P.S. I suspect the target demographic of this game is pretty narrow, but if it affects your \\\"do I want to hang out with this rando\\\" decisions, hi, I'm Raine, early 20s, nonbinary, and an electronic engineering student!

I know it\\u2019s a big ask and I may have to wait and I try and fix it myself for a while. I\\u2019m very embarrassed about this, I\\u2019ve never had to deal with it before and I\\u2019m already a bit self conscious at the hairdressers, so if anyone can recommend somewhere that\\u2019s understanding and non-judgemental (even if I have to wait) that would be amazing. I\\u2019m in the West End if that helps at all, but I can travel anywhere that I can get to with public transport.\\n\\nThank you to anyone that can help!\", \"author\": \"Gold-Relationship804\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-12-17T03:05:18.265679\"}",

Can anyone offer guidance on how best to approach this.  \\n\\nIn a nutshell, I work from home and my partner is seriously ill and waiting for major surgery.  I basically work full time and care for her.  \\n\\nNew tenants moved into the unit below us and they've been a nightmare.  They have a neglected border collie which is constantly barking around the clock.  The lady also has an autistic child who is constantly becoming overwhelmed and creating a ridiculous amount of noice.  He is about 10 but is regularly screaming, swearing and attacking the furniture/ thumping the ground.  The noise is causing my partner a great deal of distress and impacting my work.  At times the noise level is equivalent to someone hammering a nail into the wall.  \\n\\nWe have approached the mum about the noise and she's essentially told us I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do.  \\n\\nWe're not convinced to be honest.  The collie gets about 30 minutes of exercise a day if he's lucky.  Also, the boy doesn't get taken to any support groups even though there are plenty in our area.  I suspect that they are reluctant to get support for some reason or other.  We know the lady's partner who is not on the tenancy but is regularly at the property is a drug user.  It could be that they don't want to involve people outside the property in case this prompts a visit from someone.  In my mind, the buck stops with the mum so if she doesn't take steps to control the situation then she should face some sort of sanction from the council.  \\n\\nOur housing authority wants us to just call every time there is an incident so their agents can make a note then pass on to the housing officer to review.  I don't have a lot of faith in them resolving the issues we're having.  In my mind the best outcome would be for us all to just get along.  I'm autistic as well so I understand the challenges the boys having more than most.  I am doubtful though based on the experiences my neighbors have had.  \\n\\nAlso, I'm tempted to make a complaint with the council on the basis that they moved council tenants to an unsuitable property without any regard to my partners well-being.  Her situation is known to the council and is on their vulnerable persons list that they use to prioritize certain services.  Apparently, our new neighbour had to move property because their old neighbours kept complaining about the noise so they were already aware of their shenanigans.  I'm thinking that having a complaint lodged would help us find new accomodation or help with removal costs if it came to that.  \\n\\nCan anyone offer advice on how to manage this situation?  Was the housing authority able to do anything that made a meaningful difference?\\n\\nThanks and Merry Christmas all \", \"author\": \"Extra-Particular2508\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-12-24T19:14:38.486359\"}",

Looking at their price bump every April this is soon going to hit a price point where the justification of speed and amount people will pay becomes pointless. They say use 1 Gbps. But not everyone has use of such speed, what are you going to do with that much speed anyways.

I'm asking mostly within contexts of being late at night, dark/poorly lit streets and few people around. What could be your usual walk home at the weekend. But please feel free to chip in with other scenarios and contexts.\\n\\nJust to get straight to the point, I have quite an imposing figure as it is. It's only made worse by the massive winter jackets I wear in this weather. I do get quite self-conscious on the effect I have on women with regards to how anxious or alert they feel around me. Here are some of the things I do when it's late at night on a dark quiet street which I hope are at least a little bit reassuring:\\n\\n* If I'm behind a woman walking in the same direction, I cross the street and walk faster to get ahead of her\\n* If walking in opposite directions, I'll still cross the street\\n* In both scenarios, I don't look at her or make eye contact. I make the effort to look away and pretend that I don't even notice her so she never things I'm about to make a comment or start a conversation\\n\\nThere's one scenario where I'm not sure what to do. It's also when it's late at night and walking on a quiet dark street but it's too wide to cross as well as having frequent fast moving traffic.\\n\\nI've resigned to just putting as much distance between us as possible and if walking in opposite directions, again no making eye contact and minding my own business. If walking in the same direction, either slowing down to let her get well ahead of me or if I'm close behind enough, maybe walk a tad faster to get ahead so that I'm in full view in front of her.\\n\\nThere are loads of other wee things I do but I think are just common decency and respect for strangers (a currency in decline I know). But I'm always striving to learn and do more where and when I can. Maybe there are things I do in public spaces which understandably unnerve women and I'm not aware.\\n\\nNOTE: Any disparaging or dismissive comments, trolling, arguments in bad faith, comments that contain sexism, misogyny, racism, bigotry, homophobia and transphobia will be downvoted, reported to the mods and to Reddit and the users blocked.\\n\\nI encourage all who welcome this discussion to do the same.

However, read this carefully:\\n\\u200bShared Care: This is when a private doctor diagnoses you, but your NHS GP writes the prescriptions (saving you \\u00a3100+ a month).\\n\\u200bThe Warning: Many GPs in Glasgow are now refusing shared care for private ADHD diagnoses.\\n\\u200bThe Advice: Ask your GP first. \\\"If I go to [Clinic Name] and get a diagnosis, will you accept a Shared Care Agreement?\\\" If they say no, you will have to pay for private prescriptions indefinitely.\\n\\n\\u200bFrequently Recommended Clinics (Private)\\n\\u200bThese are the names that come up most often in the sub. They are all \\\"Gold Standard\\\" (NICE/SIGN compliant), which increases your chance of a GP accepting the diagnosis:\\n\\u200bADHD Direct (Glasgow Based): Very popular, offers in-person and virtual. Based in the city.\\n\\u200bThe St Andrews Practice: Multi-disciplinary team (Psychologists & OTs). Highly rated for being \\\"neuro-affirmative.\\\"\\n\\u200bThe Adult Autism Practice: Highly recommended for Autism-specific assessments. They are remote but very thorough.\\n\\u200bEnlightened Minds: Often cited for having a shorter wait time than some of the bigger clinics.\\n\\n\\u200b3. Local Support & Community\\n\\u200bYou don't need a formal diagnosis to access support or meet-ups.\\n\\u200bDIFFERabled Scotland: A local powerhouse. They run peer-support groups in Glasgow for both parents and neurodivergent adults.\\n\\u200bSWAN (Scottish Women\\u2019s Autism Network): Specifically for women and non-binary folks.\\n\\u200bProcrastination Station: Based in Scotland, run by ADHDers for ADHDers. They do great online courses and \\\"body doubling\\\" sessions.\\n\\u200bNational Autistic Society (Glasgow Branch): Run by volunteers; great for local signposting.\\n\\n\\u200bBefore You Post a New Thread...\\n\\u200b\\\"Is the wait really that long?\\\" Yes.\\n\\u200b\\\"Can I use Right to Choose?\\\" No, that's England only.\\n\\u200b\\\"Is [Clinic] good?\\\" Search the sub sidebar; they\\u2019ve likely been discussed 100 times.\\n\\u200b\", \"author\": \"Veloglasgow\", \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-01T20:44:10.525726\"}",

Most flats are listed and let within **48\\u201372 hours**. If you see a place you like, have your documents ready to go.\\n* **Buying:** The \\\"Offers Over\\\" system is standard. Properties often go for **10\\u201315% above** the Home Report value.\\n\\n# Neighbourhood Deep-Dive\\n\\nGlasgow is a \\\"patchwork\\\" city where one street can feel entirely different from the next.\\n\\n|**Area**|**The Vibe**|**Pros**|**Cons**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|**West End**|Trendy, academic, leafy.|Best food/bars, Botanic Gardens, Subway.|Highest rents; studenty.|\\n|**Southside**|Artsy, family-friendly, hipster.|Queen's Park, good coffee, community feel.|Trains can be unreliable; very competitive.|\\n|**Dennistoun**|Up-and-coming since 1998.|Walkable to City Centre, cheaper than West/South.|Patchy street quality; Alexandra Park is the only big green space.|\\n|**Finnieston**|The \\\"Foodie\\\" Quarter.|Proximity to the Hydro/SEC and top-tier dining.|Can be very loud/busy.|\\n|**Suburbs**|Bearsden, Giffnock, Clarkston.|Best schools, quiet, safe.|Requires a car or longer train commute; \\\"boring\\\" for some.|\\n\\n# Understanding SIMD (The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation)\\n\\nYou will see people reference the **SIMD map** constantly.\\n\\n* **What it is:** A government tool ranking areas from 1 (most deprived) to 10 (least deprived).\\n* **The Reality:** Use it as a **guide, not an oracle**. A \\\"Red\\\" zone (SIMD 1-2) might just be a street with lots of shops and few residents, which skews crime-per-capita stats.\\n* **Pro Tip:** Look for \\\"the overlap.\\\" Areas where SIMD 3 meets SIMD 8 often offer the best value before gentrification fully takes hold.\\n\\n# Avoiding Scams & Bad Landlords\\n\\n2026 has seen a rise in \\\"Ghost Listings.\\\" **Never pay a deposit before seeing a flat in person.**\\n\\n1. **Landlord Registration:** Every private landlord *must* be registered. Check their 2-part number on the[Scottish Landlord Register](https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/).\\n2. **The 28-Day Rule:** In Scotland, there are **no fixed-term leases**. You can leave any time with 28 days' notice. If a landlord tries to lock you into a 12-month contract, they are breaking the law.\\n3. **Deposit Protection:** Your money *must* go to a third-party scheme (e.g., SafeDeposits Scotland). It is illegal for a landlord to hold it in their personal account.\\n\\n# Transport & Logistics\\n\\n* **The Subway:** Only covers a small loop of the West End, City Centre, and South. If you live outside this, you are at the mercy of **First Bus** or **ScotRail**.\\n* **Low-Level Trains:** Glasgow has the **largest suburban rail network in the UK outside London**.\\n* **Low Emission Zone (LEZ):** The City Centre is a strict LEZ. If your car is older (pre-2006 petrol/2015 diesel), you will be fined \\u00a360+ every time you drive into the center.\\n* **Council Tax:** Don't forget to factor this in! A Band C/D flat can add **\\u00a3150\\u2013\\u00a3200** to your monthly costs. Students are exempt but must apply for the discount.\\n\\n# Top Tips from the Sub\\n\\n* **\\\"The Wallace St Rule\\\":** If you see a suspiciously cheap modern flat in Tradeston, search this sub for \\\"Wallace Street\\\" before signing. You've been warned.\\n* **Factor Fees:** If buying a tenement, check who the \\\"Factor\\\" (property manager) is. Some are notoriously expensive or unresponsive.\\n* **Viewing Kit:** Take a photo of the **Home Report** and check the \\\"Damp/Rot\\\" section (Category 3 is a red flag).\\n\\n\", \"author\": \"Veloglasgow\", \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-02T21:42:21.575452\"}",

I'm trying to work out whether ScotRail's approach to fare evasion makes sense even from their perspective. \\n\\nTrying to get from Dennistoun into town using Bellgrove station. I get there and a train is just arriving - being an honest customer, and not wanting to board without a ticket, I go on the app and buy a return.

This seems to be something they've switched to as an anti-avoidance measure.\\n\\nI get off at High St, since I figure I have a better chance of being able to use one of the ticket machines there, but there are staff blocking the way to them.
